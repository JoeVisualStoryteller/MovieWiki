## Joseph (knight trained in death magic)
- Fully human male knight trained in death magic; alive, disciplined, and grounded
- Obsidian-black matte plate armor with subtle sigils that only activate when he channels power
- Face visible and uncovered; helmet carried in his left hand
- Eyes natural at rest; glow only when death magic is active
- Emotionally restrained; decisive action driven by duty and protection, not rage
- Former honor guard to The Queen when she was a princess; bond defined by loyalty, unspoken love, and sacrifice
- Must never be portrayed as undead, resurrected, cursed, decaying, feral, or exaggerated in magic
- Usage: include once; refer to him only as **Joseph** or **the knight trained in death magic**; never use the title “Death Knight”

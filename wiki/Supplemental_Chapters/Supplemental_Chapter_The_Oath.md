# Supplemental Chapter - The Oath

## Placement

After the successful siege defense and Joseph's collapse, before he wakes. The realm is stabilized but the cost is visible.

## Scene

Joseph did not wake.

Alexiana counted days in visits and reports, in the way the city moved because it was forced to. She attended councils, signed requisitions, and listened to the Paladin champion call him a risk while the city called him a miracle. When the chamber emptied, she went to the Reliquary with the King Consort at her side, as duty required, and sat by the bed as herself.

At first he lay in the inner hall where only the few were allowed. The stone there was cold enough to numb prayer. Then, on the eighth day, she found him moved.

The cot was in the outer reliquary, closer to the corridor where guards and clerks could see him. The banners were hung back, the wards thinner. People moved past with their eyes lowered and their mouths quiet. It was a deliberate change. The court had decided the city needed to see its deterrent made mortal.

He was still unconscious. His lips were the wrong color. A line of dried blood trailed from his nose to his cheek. Bandages wrapped his ribs; another wrapped the wrist where the magic had split his skin. His gauntlets rested on a table, empty and patient.

Alexiana stopped short. Her spine held, but her throat did not. The sound she made was quiet and human. Aelius put his hand at her elbow and did not pull her back. He had learned the difference between risk and cruelty.

"They moved him," she said.

"For the city," Aelius answered. "To remind them he bleeds too."

She did not argue. She sat anyway and laid her palm on the back of Joseph's hand. The skin was cold. She waited for the tremor that meant he was somewhere inside it. It did not come.

The King and Queen entered together the next evening.

They did not wear crowns. They wore travel cloaks and the kind of fatigue that never quite left a ruler's posture. The Queen's eyes softened when she saw Joseph; the King exhaled slowly, as if the weight of a decision had finally found its place.

Alexiana stood. "You should not be here," she said.

Her father looked at the cot. "We should have come sooner."

Her mother moved to Joseph's side, touching his wrist with two fingers, then lifting her hand as if the cold might follow her. "They put him here to be seen," she said. "As if visibility could settle their fear."

"It won't," Alexiana said.

The Queen studied her daughter. "Then let it settle yours."

Alexiana swallowed. "I am not afraid of him. I am afraid of losing him before I ever knew him."

The King drew a breath. "We owe you a story."

She looked up sharply. "The Council forbade it."

"The Council forbade it because it made you too close," her mother said. "The Grand Maester agreed. We did not."

The King set his cloak aside and sat on a bench opposite the cot, eyes on his hands. "It was before you wore a crown. Before you were meant to carry a war."

He looked at Joseph. "Two nations in the east were fighting each other. East-North and East-South. They wanted to pull Astraea into their feud, to make us choose a side and bleed for it. We refused. They sent raiders to our border towns anyway, hoping to force our hand."

"The Council wanted a formal warning," the Queen said. "We wanted speed."

"We sent Joseph," the King continued. "Not as an army. As a question."

Alexiana's eyes narrowed. "Against the Council's orders."

Her father nodded once. "Against their orders. They called it reckless. We called it necessary."

He looked down at his hands again. "Joseph struck the command structures. He did not raze villages. He did not burn fields. He found their officers, their messengers, their oath-keepers, and he broke the chain without breaking the people. It was harsh. It was deliberate. It brought both armies to their knees."

"How did he do it without turning it into slaughter?" Alexiana asked.

"He used restraint," her mother said. "Surgically precise. Every step measured, every action exacting a cost from them and from him."

"He forced capitulation by bringing the rulers to the table," the Queen said. "He made them see that Astraea would not be drawn in on their terms. They came to meet us with treaties instead of threats."

The King let out a slow breath. "We rode to the meeting. We thought it done. Then dissidents from both sides tried to spoil it. They wanted war regardless of their commanders' surrender."

Alexiana leaned forward. "The Paladin was there."

"Was he hurt?" she asked, already knowing the answer by the way her father's jaw tightened.

"He was," her father said. "He took a blade meant for me. He lived, but his oath-light dimmed for a time."

The Queen's hand tightened on her cloak. "There were too many of them. Not undead. Living. Angry. Desperate. Joseph stepped between them and us. He raised his hand and the air went cold. He did not take their breath. He did not turn them. He held them, slowed them, pushed them back without compulsion. It cost him more than it should have."

The King nodded. "He was wounded. Blades found his ribs, his shoulder, the side of his jaw. He kept his control anyway. We lived because he refused to take what he could have taken. He chose restraint even as they tried to kill him."

Alexiana's hand tightened on Joseph's. "You never told me this."

"We were told not to," her mother said. "The Grand Maester feared you would anchor to him too early. The Council feared you would insist on him too loudly. They were wrong to keep it from you."

The King lifted his gaze. "When we returned, we finalized the treaty. Astraea did not enter the war. We kept our borders. We kept our people."

"And Joseph?" Alexiana asked.

Her mother looked at Joseph's unconscious face. "We thanked him. We healed him. We promoted him to Honor Guard for you. It was the only vow we could give him that did not bind him to a throne. It was the closest we could come to honoring what he had done without breaking doctrine."

Alexiana's throat burned. "He saved Astraea before he ever stood behind me."

"He saved Astraea so you could stand here at all," her father said quietly.

Silence held the outer hall. The guards kept their eyes forward. The city moved past the open doors, pretending it had not heard the truth that had never been spoken.

Alexiana bent and pressed her forehead to Joseph's hand. Her shoulders shook once, then stilled. When she looked up, her jaw was set, her spine straight, her eyes wet but clear.

"You carried that story without me," she said to her parents. "I will carry it now. I will not let them use him as a symbol without paying him the honor they owe."

Her mother smiled sadly. "That is why he was sent to you."

"He was sent to us," the King corrected. "By consent."

Alexiana nodded once. She touched Joseph's wrist again and felt nothing but cold. She stayed anyway.

When she rose, she did not ask the guards to leave. She knew she could not. She lifted her chin, let the city see her composure, and let her grief burn quietly behind her teeth.

"Tomorrow," she said to the King Consort, "we reinforce the wards. If they want to see him, they will see him safe."

Aelius nodded. "As you command."

She looked back at Joseph one more time. "Stay," she whispered, not as an order but as a promise. "I will do the rest."

## Interlude - The Grand Maester's Confession

### Setting

Black Reliquary outer hall. Night. Rain ticks on stone. Joseph lies half-propped on a cot, eyes dim from the bridge strike and the grain run. His breath is thin and cold. Alexiana stands with arms folded, crown set aside. King Consort Aelius paces, not yet understanding why he has been summoned. The Grand Maester holds a sealed tin box, knuckles white, breath fogging in the cold.

### Scene

"Open it," Alexiana said.

The Grand Maester hesitated, then broke the seal. The lid lifted with a soft metal sigh. Inside: brittle parchment, a ring of dark iron, a strip of child's linen with faded initials not J. The iron smelled faintly of old blood and oil. The linen smelled of smoke and time.

"Before I was guardian of restraint," he said, voice low, "I was guardian of secrets. Truth is a weight; it demands I speak now."

Joseph's gaze lifted. His voice was almost nothing. "You decide the cost now?"

"No," the Grand Maester said. "The war decides. I choose to stop lying before it ends me."

He unrolled the parchment. The script was cramped and formal, the wax brittle. A betrothal contract: Alexiana of Astraea to the firstborn of House Vale. The child's given name was not Joseph.

Aelius stopped pacing. His breath hitched. "That is my brother's name," he breathed. "The brother we do not speak of."

Alexiana's voice was iron. "The brother taken. The deterrent forged. Joseph."

Joseph looked up slowly, the name tasting foreign. "I had another name."

"I took you," the Grand Maester said. "I erased the record. I renamed you. I chose deterrence over dynasty because the world required a deterrent, not a crown."

"You stole a consort to build a weapon," Alexiana said.

He met her gaze, unflinching. "I stole a child to stop a world from burning. I broke consent to preserve creation. I carry that sin because it was the cost."

"You carried it while I carried your oaths," Joseph said. His voice was steady; his hands trembled on the blanket.

Aelius staggered back, a hand to his mouth. "I am the substitute." Anger flared, then drained into shame. "My parents buried him. Buried you. To hide the loss."

"They buried me before I died," Joseph said.

Aelius turned on the Grand Maester. "You let my house choke on shame while you forged him in the dark?"

"I let them because if they knew, they would have dragged him back to the throne and made him a crown instead of a deterrent," the Grand Maester said. "The world could not afford that dynasty."

### Alexiana's Authority

Alexiana stepped between them. "Hear me. Joseph was mine before he was deterrent. He is deterrent because the Grand Maester chose for me. I do not forgive that. I choose to continue because the world still burns."

Her words were a blade and a hinge. Aelius stilled. Joseph closed his eyes as if to brace.

### Consent and Doctrine

"Doctrine forbids Death Knights from ruling," the Grand Maester said. "It forbids a monarch to wed one. I thought burying the betrothal would protect the throne."

"You buried consent," Alexiana said. "You created this taboo by trying to dodge it. We live inside the sin you made."

Joseph closed his eyes, voice low. "Consent broken at the start does not excuse breaking it now. We will not repeat you."

### Aelius's Choice

Aelius looked from parchment to Joseph. "If I expose this, the court erupts. If I hide it, I live a fiction."

"Choose," Alexiana said. "Ally. Obstacle. Witness. No dominion."

He exhaled, shoulders dropping. "I choose to keep the realm alive. I will keep the fiction for them, and the truth for us. But I will not be your shield."

"Then name your cost," Joseph said. "Consent applies to you as well."

"Respect," Aelius said. "No more erasing. No more ghosts in my halls without my knowing."

Alexiana nodded once. "Done."

### Addendum - The Dismissal and the Exile

"When I urged the court to dismiss you from the Honor Guard, it was not mercy," the Grand Maester said. "It was positioning. They would have paraded you; I needed you deniable."

Alexiana's eyes narrowed. "You exiled my consort to use him as a ghost."

He nodded, guilt thick but voice steady. "I sent him against the Necrotic King alone. Better him striking than living and feeding that army. I kept contact - dead drops, oath-letters. Every raid the West called 'miracle' was him under my direction."

Joseph looked between them. "You told me it was my path. You never said you engineered the dismissal."

"If you had stayed as Honor Guard, they would have chained you to the throne or killed you," the Grand Maester said. "I chose exile to keep you alive for the war only you could fight."

Alexiana's anger broke the careful quiet. "You chose my rage and years without him to serve your doctrine. You do not get to call that protection."

He bowed his head. "I do not. I record it. I do not ask forgiveness."

"And all the while you told me the Necrotic King was mine alone to face," Joseph said.

"Because it is," the Grand Maester replied. "Because you are the deterrent built for him."

"Built without consent," Alexiana said. "Twice. I will not let you make a third theft."

He nodded once, brittle. "Then let this be the last theft."

### The Coronation as Leash

"There is one more theft," the Grand Maester said. "Your coronation day."

Alexiana stilled. "What about it?"

"I ordered him back to the city that morning. I let him see you crowned with another man. I needed his focus on the war, not on the life he was denied."

Joseph's gaze hardened. "You used me to keep me obedient."

"I used pain to sharpen restraint," the Grand Maester said. "I believed it righteous."

### Alexiana Breaks

Alexiana's control snapped. She lunged, grief turning to fury. The King Consort and two knights caught her, arms locking around her shoulders. Her knees buckled, then held; her breath tore; the inside of her mouth tasted of blood.

"Let me go," she said, voice broken and sharp. "Let me end this."

Aelius held her, his own voice tight. "Alexiana, stop. He is old. He is still necessary."

"Necessary does not absolve him," she said. "None of this excuses him."

The Grand Maester did not move. "I will not flinch. I will not justify it. I chose to make you suffer so the world could endure."

Alexiana shook against the hands holding her, tears hot and relentless. "You were my trust. The voice I believed. My betrayal."

Her breath finally broke into a ragged silence. Aelius kept his grip until she stilled.

### The Buried Name

The Grand Maester whispered Joseph's birth name aloud: "Justian Vale." It felt like a bell struck underwater. Joseph repeated it once, then let it go.

Aelius exhaled like he had been punched. "Justian," he said, the family name a knife and a balm. Alexiana closed her eyes briefly, as if filing the sound into memory and rage at once.

### The Training You Forgot

"The training," the Grand Maester said. "I drove you past limit. You woke in these stone cells; your breath frosted. I held your head under water until black dots ate your sight. I called it discipline. Days without sun; nights carved into drills. Sleep broken by oaths screamed until your voice bled. I hung weights from your arms until your shoulders dislocated, then set them in ice and did it again. Any other child would have broken. This room holds you because I bound you to it with pain I called righteous."

Joseph's jaw worked, memory flickering in his eyes. "I remember enough."

Aelius gripped a pillar so hard his knuckles blanched. "You did this to a boy meant to marry my sister."

Alexiana swayed, one hand braced on cold stone, nausea and fury rising. "You tortured my consort in my house. You made his restraint a cage of wounds." Her other hand curled as if around a blade she did not draw.

"I made him the deterrent that could face a living god without dominion," the Grand Maester said.

Alexiana stepped close, voice barely contained. "You made him carry your sin so you could sleep. If you were not necessary, I would end you here."

Aelius's fist clenched; for a heartbeat, he looked ready to strike the old man. Joseph lifted a hand, stopping him with a look.

### Closing

Alexiana closed the tin box. "This stays sealed from the court. The Paladin accuser will not have this fuel. When the war ends, we decide how to tell it. Until then, we use it as leverage, not confession."

The Grand Maester bowed his head. "Thank you for allowing me to speak it before I die."

Alexiana's gaze was flint. "You are not forgiven. You are necessary. That is all."

Joseph reached for her hand; she allowed it, palm to palm - permission, not possession.

Aelius: "What do we do with this?"

Alexiana: "We use it. We do not spill it. Not yet."

Joseph: "We do what we have done: choose restraint, even with truth."

Aelius watched, understanding at last the weight he never wanted. The rain kept ticking. The world kept burning. The truth now lived, even if sealed.

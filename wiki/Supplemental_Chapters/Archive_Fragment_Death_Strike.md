### Excerpt

> We were trained to recognize corruption by its marks.
> Rot. Shadow. Animation of the unclean dead.
> What we encountered bears none of these.
> The technique the Death Knights name Death Strike cannot be categorized as necromancy, curse, poison, or divine inversion. I state this with reluctance and no small measure of dread.
> There is no injury.
> The subjects examined after exposure showed intact organs, unruptured vessels, unburned nerves. No sign of trauma. No corruption of flesh. Even the soul-sight rites revealed nothing displaced or torn away.
> And yet - life had departed completely.
> I record this plainly: there was nothing left for us to heal.
> The spell does not attack the body. It does not contest the soul. It does not even fight life in the manner of dark sorcery. Instead, it behaves as though it issues a correction.
> Breath ceases because the body no longer remembers why it should breathe.
> The heart stills because it is no longer instructed to beat.
> The mind falls silent because its signals are answered by nothing at all.
> This is not destruction.
> It is revocation.
> We attempted every countermeasure.
> Purification failed.
> Sanctified healing failed.
> Invocation of Astraea herself produced no reaction - not resistance, not recoil, not defiance.
> The Death Strike does not oppose the Light.
> It ignores it.
> I find this the most alarming aspect.
> Our doctrine assumes all things that kill must be resisted, countered, or cleansed. Death Strike acknowledges no such contest. It behaves as a final authority acting within its proper jurisdiction.
> As if death itself had been asked a question -
> and answered.
> I must address a dangerous misconception circulating among junior Paladins.
> They believe that greater faith, stronger wards, or purer hearts will grant immunity.
> This is false.
> Faith strengthens resolve.
> Wards delay intrusion.
> Purity preserves the soul.
> None of these compel the body to continue living once Death has spoken.
> The most heretical realization - and I record this under protest - is this:
> If Death Strike is an abomination, then the universe itself is complicit.
> The magic leaves no stain. No imbalance. No lingering echo. The world accepts the outcome without protest. The corpse does not resist being a corpse.
> That acceptance terrifies me.
> For if Death Knights wield Death not as thieves, but as appointed instruments, then our Order has misunderstood its enemy for centuries.
> And worse -
> We may not be the highest authority standing between the living and the end.
> May the Light forgive me for writing this.

### Archivist Note

Hand copied from a sealed Radiant Seal folio; original ink is dark iron-blue, margins frost-scorched. The author name is intact, but the docket seal is burned through, suggesting deliberate suppression during the anathema purges.

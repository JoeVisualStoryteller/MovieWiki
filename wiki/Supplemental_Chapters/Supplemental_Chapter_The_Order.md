# Supplemental Chapter - The Order

## Placement

Act 3 era flashback, during Alexiana's final courses before ascension.

## Scene

The instructor did not come.

Alexiana sat with her notebooks open, ink still wet on the margins. The classroom smelled of chalk and old wood. Joseph stood at the window, eyes on the courtyard below, as if the world outside required his full attention even here. When the door opened, it was the Grand Maester who entered, cloak folded back, staff in hand.

"Your tutor is ill," he said. "I will substitute."

Alexiana did not object. She wanted the lesson. She wanted every lesson.

He stood at the front and did not sit. "Today," he said, "we speak of the Order of Men Who Dance With Death."

Her pen paused. "Death Knights."

"Yes." The Grand Maester's voice was calm, practiced. "They were made when the world still believed the dead could be bargained with. They were a last answer, not a first. Each took an oath and chose a discipline. Attack. Defense. Summoning. Restraint was the cost that kept the power from becoming dominion."

He moved through the story without looking at his notes. "They were hunted when the councils feared what they could not command. Kings called them abominations. One by one, they were killed or erased, until the Order became memory and rumor."

He did not stop there. "The Order was not born whole," he continued. "It was assembled in desperation."

He paced once, the staff quiet against the floor.

"Creation. The first Death Knights were forged at the end of wars that refused to end. Kings had exhausted treaties. Councils had exhausted men. Death Magic was sanctioned as a deterrent -- not to conquer, not to rule, but to make escalation unbearable."

"Weaponization. Success invited misuse. Councils asked for repeat deployments. Recovery was shortened. Restraint was praised publicly and punished privately. They were kept distant from civilian life, forbidden intimacy -- not as doctrine, but as precaution."

"The first violation came when one Knight escalated," the Grand Maester said, voice flattening. "Not from ambition. From exhaustion. He used Death Magic on the living to end a war faster. Choice was removed. Dominion was touched."

Silence settled.

"The purge followed. Paladin Orders were empowered to hunt what had been sanctioned. Some surrendered. Some fled. Most died -- not in battle, but through attrition, betrayal, or enforced overuse. The world decided deterrence was more frightening than war."

"The survivors retreated into secrecy to prevent repetition," he said, and his eyes lifted, briefly, to Joseph. "That is the history. As it is taught."

Joseph kept his eyes on the window, jaw set.

Alexiana listened, then lifted her hand slightly. "How many were there at their peak?"

"Twelve," he said. "Enough to deter, never enough to conquer."

She wrote it down. "Why does Death Magic take so much from them?"

The Grand Maester looked at her, then at Joseph, as if measuring how much truth she could carry. "They dance with death so that others may live," he said. "The cost is the tether. It pulls at their breath, their mind, their body. Restraint is the only way to keep the tether from snapping."

Alexiana looked at Joseph as the words settled. He kept his eyes on the window, but the line of his shoulders went rigid. The seed of something unnamed took root.

She flipped a page. "So why do we keep one?"

"Because we cannot afford to forget what the world is," he said. "Astraea survives because deterrence exists."

Her gaze moved back to Joseph. "Which power do you have, Joseph?"

Joseph did not answer.

The Grand Maester spoke for him. "He was given all three. Attack, defense, summoning." His voice cooled. "He is the only Death Knight to hold the full spectrum."

Alexiana blinked. "I thought each knight chose one."

"They did," the Grand Maester said. "He is the exception, not the rule."

Joseph's hands tightened at his sides. He said nothing.

She hesitated, then asked, "I heard rumors that a Death Knight saved Astraea once."

The Grand Maester's mouth flattened. "Rumors," he said. "Stories for soldiers. The Order was never meant for legend. It was meant for cost."

Joseph looked away from the window for the first time and then looked back, as if the light outside had become too sharp.

Alexiana set down her pen. "Can he show me? Just once?"

"No," the Grand Maester said immediately.

"Why?" she asked. "If he is meant to deter, should I not understand what that means?"

"You will understand it in the field," he said. "Not in a classroom. Restraint is not a performance."

"Then tell me how a Death Knight is trained," she said. "If I am to rule with one at my side, I should know what you demand of him."

The Grand Maester folded his hands over the staff. "They are broken before they are bound. Their minds and bodies are tested beyond the limits of ordinary men. They are taught every form of restraint, because power without restraint becomes dominion."

"And if they fail?" Alexiana asked.

"Then the order ends," he said. "As it should."

She looked at Joseph again. His face was still, but the line of his mouth held irritation like a blade behind his teeth. When the Grand Maester spoke too smoothly, Joseph's eyes narrowed by a fraction, then smoothed again. He did not correct him. He did not contradict him. He kept watch.

The Grand Maester dismissed the lesson with a nod. "That is enough for today."

Alexiana remained seated a moment longer, pen in hand, watching Joseph at the window. He did not turn, but he was there, steady and silent.

She closed her book and said, quietly, "I will learn it all anyway."

Joseph did not answer. He did not need to. The promise was already in the room.

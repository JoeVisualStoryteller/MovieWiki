# Supplemental Chapter - The Muster

## Placement

Late Act IV / early Act V, a rewrite of the final battle sequence before the last confrontation.

## Scene

Joseph had been awake for three days and Alexiana had not seen him once.

She learned later how the summons came: no herald, no messenger, only a cold blade pressed against his mind with four words. **Meet me where you stopped my assault.** She learned that he and the Grand Maester rode to the old collapse ridge and found the Necrotic King waiting in the open, unmoving, as if war itself had chosen a body. She learned the promise, the threat. But in the moment it mattered, she only knew this: the guard captain burst into the council chamber and said Joseph was on the wall.

She arrived at the battlements with the Grand Maester at her shoulder, the council tight at her back, Aelius just behind her, the Paladin accuser's hand already on his hilt.

Joseph did not look back.

He stood on the parapet as if it were a threshold and lifted his hand.

The dead rose. Then they rose again. Then again. It was not a spectacle of chaos but a geometry of restraint. To Alexiana, it was a wall of shadow forming in the field. To Joseph alone, she knew without being told, it was more precise: living soldiers and living paladins woven among the undead, a formation shaped for balance, not display. The perfect army, built to hold, not conquer.

Eleven figures stepped forward from the forming ranks. Death Knight generals, echoes given shape. They knelt in the dirt and waited for his word. He spoke to them in a low cadence, a brief conferral of positions and restraint.

The living guards on the wall spoke quickly in her ear, filling in the hours: the Necrotic King appearing at the ridge; Joseph and the Grand Maester riding to meet him; the warning of a coming trick; the summons of the dead and the generals.

A councilor at her shoulder whispered, "This is not a siege. This is a display."

"He is showing us what he intends," another said, voice tight. "If this is his trick, what comes after?"

Alexiana kept her eyes on Joseph. "We hold," she said. "Until we see the shape of it."

She tried to catch his attention, once, then again, stepping to the edge of the parapet. "Joseph—"

He did not answer. He could not. It stung in a way she had not expected. It was not defiance. It was a trance, a focus so complete it left nothing for her to hold.

Joseph lifted his hand. "Archers," he said. "One volley. Light and fire."

The command echoed down the line. A general bellowed, "Light." An undead cavalry rider broke from the wedge and rode parallel to the wall, a torch held high. He raised it to the prepared pitch, and the archers dipped their heads, touching flame to oil. Another general called, "Loose."

The sky flashed as one arc of fire rose and fell, a single breath of flame cast across the field.

A Death Knight general watched the strike. "Effective," he said.

Joseph's gaze stayed on the enemy line. "I'm waiting for the Paladins to answer," he said. "I need to find where they're buried in that line."

The Paladin accuser snapped toward Alexiana. "What did he say?"

Joseph raised his hand again. "Second volley."

The generals relayed the order, each voice clean and precise. "Second volley. Light. Loose."

The second arc lifted, and then the field brightened with holy light. Paladins in the Necrotic King's line raised wards. The arrows died in the air, their fire snuffed, their shafts falling harmlessly.

The High Priestess whispered behind her, "That's holy light."

Another councilor answered, low and afraid, "Then he owns more than the dead."

The Paladin accuser staggered. "He enslaves my kin," he breathed. "How is this possible?"

The council murmured behind Alexiana, the worry catching and multiplying. "If he can take theirs, he can take ours," someone said. "If the Paladins are in that line, where are they hiding?" another asked.

Alexiana held her chin level. She had no full answer to give them, no words to offer that were not guesses. She kept her voice still anyway, the queen she could be while the rest of her wanted to turn and demand truth from Joseph.

Joseph did not look back. He turned to his generals. "Prepare my cavalry. We engage the Paladins. Only enough to open the path." His voice dropped. "I will take them directly. On my signal—unleash hell."

The words landed like a blade. Alexiana, the King Consort, the Paladin accuser, and the council all went still at once.

A living knight came up the stairs two at a time, breathless. "Is it true the Necrotic King fights with the living?" he asked. "Allow us to ride with you. We ride until death, sir."

Joseph studied the man for a beat, then nodded. "Ride."

As he turned, a child slipped from the line of bystanders with a braided cord in her hands. She reached up, fingers shaking, and pressed the charm bracelet against his gauntlet. Joseph paused, slid it over the metal, and gave her a small, surprised smile before she was snatched back by her mother.

"Apologies, my lord," the woman said, pulling the child behind her skirt.

Alexiana saw it all. The brief softness hurt and steadied her at once.

The cavalry formed at the gates with a thin wedge of undead. Joseph left the generals in command of the main body. He looked once toward Alexiana. She steadied, the sting easing; he had been honoring her authority the entire time, even in silence. He spoke to the nearest general. "Explain. Tell them why I could not answer."

The general bowed and turned to Alexiana. "He cannot divide his mind," he said, loud enough for the council and the Paladin to hear. "He is holding the line and the living at once. The dead answer only to a single will. The living in that formation are being kept from turning by the same hand. If he speaks, one side falters. If he looks away, the line opens. If he yields his focus for a breath, the living die. The cost is silence."

The King Consort exhaled beside her. "He is carrying too much alone," Aelius said quietly.

A councilor pressed a hand to the parapet. "If that line breaks, we lose everything."

The Paladin accuser said nothing, but his jaw had gone tight, his gaze fixed on the living figures threaded through the dead.

Alexiana swallowed the hurt and held it. "Then tell him I understand," she said, voice clear enough for all of them to hear. "Tell him I will not take his focus from the line. Tell him I will wait for his silence and answer with mine."

The gate opened. Joseph rode out.

The skirmish was brief and violent. He met the Paladin line with a small wedge, enough to break their cohesion without emptying the main formation. The living knights rode with him, banners low, blades clean. The Grand Maester rode at Joseph's flank, staff low and ready. Their charge split the warded line; the wards flared and shattered; horses screamed; steel met steel; bone met bone.

Above, the Paladin accuser watched and went pale. His doctrine had no place for enslaved kin on the enemy side. It fractured him in silence.

Joseph lifted his hand toward the Grand Maester. The old man understood without a word. His staff flared, and a thin column of deathlight speared the sky—an unmistakable signal to the generals.

The Death Knight generals acknowledged the signal and sent the main body forward into the undead ranks.

"Advance," one of the generals called.

"Crush them," another answered.

"Archers and artillery, fire at will," a third commanded, the order rolling across the field like a drumbeat.

The field became noise and motion. Undead against undead. Living against living. The lines matched in number for the first time in years, and the balance held. The sky dimmed under the weight of it. The ground shook with the cadence of hooves and the wet crack of steel.

Joseph found the Necrotic King in the churn. They met without words. Muramasa answered the dark blade, a ringing that made the air thicken. They traded strikes. The Necrotic King feinted, then cut high, grazing the back of Joseph's neck. For a breath, there was only cold and steel.

The Grand Maester shifted in the periphery, a precise line of sight opening between bodies. His staff flared once. A pulse of death magic struck the Necrotic King cleanly. The Necrotic King staggered.

Joseph used the opening. He drove his blade through the Necrotic King's guard in the same motion.

For a breath, the Necrotic King looked almost human. In his eyes, Alexiana saw the realization flicker from his line to the wall: Joseph had given up the only power that could ever return him. This death was final.

The Necrotic King fell.

Joseph did not stay to watch him hit the earth. He turned his horse and rode back to the gates, blood running down his collar. He re-formed before his generals and the surviving living, and he bowed his head.

"It was an honor," he said. "Rest."

The echoes dissolved. The undead folded into dust. The living exhaled.

Alexiana descended the stairs as the gates opened. The generals approached her with reports. The Paladin accuser stood broken and silent, his eyes fixed on the empty field where his kin had fought on the wrong side.

They praised Joseph. They called him miracle, shield, king in all but name. A councilor found his voice. "We have seen the Necrotic King's reach," he said. "And we have seen the only thing that holds against it."

Joseph stared past them with a blankness that did not belong to him.

Alexiana felt the wrongness before she understood it. He did not look at her. He did not answer. His gauntleted hands hung at his sides, still. The trance had not lifted. Or something else had taken its place.

He took one step, as if to take a knee, and collapsed forward, armor striking stone. The sound snapped the room.

Aelius moved first. "Out of the way," he said, already pushing through the council to reach him.

A councilor caught his arm. "Your Grace, the optics—"

He shook free. "He saved this room. He saved her. If you want to talk about optics, start with that."

Alexiana dropped to her knees beside him. When she turned his head, she saw it: the scar at the back of his neck, fresh and pale, a seam that had not been there when he rode out. It did not bleed. It did not glow. It only was. She knew what it meant. The echoes were gone. Her shoulder blocked the view; no one else saw the seam.

The world went silent. She screamed only inside her ribs.

"To the Reliquary," she said, voice steady, hands shaking. "Now."

They lifted him. Not only guards—citizens reached in, hands steady, carrying him at her word. The Grand Maester moved to her side. The council followed. The city cheered the end of a battle it did not yet understand, while Alexiana carried the final cost in her arms.

At the Reliquary doors, she stopped them all. The Grand Maester raised the ward at her nod, a thin, humming veil that shut out every voice but her own. The council waited in the corridor, a line of shadows watching without crossing the line.

Aelius stepped close. "Alexiana—"

He lowered his voice. "What if they see you?"

She shook her head once. "Let them. I will stay."

Hours later the cold in the room shifted. Joseph did not wake, but his breath steadied beneath her palm.

"I promised," she said. She touched the scar with two fingers. "May I?" There was no answer. She let her hand fall back to his chest and kept it there, counting the beat as if it were an oath.

She climbed onto the cot beside him, careful of his ribs, and lay at his side without taking. Her forehead rested to his temple, her crown set aside. It was intimacy without demand, devotion without entitlement, the only kind she could claim while he slept.

Outside the ward, the council waited. They could not hear, but they could see her shadow bent over him, the crown set aside. The Queen chose her devotion without spectacle, and the room did not move against her.

# Supplemental Chapter - The Last Oath

## Placement

Late in the war, after Joseph is weakened and before the final balance settles. This is a high-cost climax variant centered on corruption, rescue, and a final act of restraint.

## Scene

The Grand Maester stood alone in the Reliquary with a relic he had sworn never to open. The seal was old and heavy, a ring of runes that asked for restraint and smelled, now, of damp earth and rust. He told himself it was only to check the wards. He told himself the war allowed no delay. When his fingers touched the rim, the cold did not pull away. It climbed.

The voice that answered him was not loud. It did not need to be.

"You are tired," it said. "You are alone. You are the last honest man in a city that has learned to lie to survive."

He did not answer. He did not need to. The voice knew the shape of his guilt and the contours of his pride. It did not command him. It asked him to agree. That was worse.

He opened the seal.

The corruption took him quietly. It slipped into his vows like a worm in a root, into the old oaths that had never been tested by a voice like that. It did not break them. It bent them, just enough to point him elsewhere.

When he walked to Alexiana, he looked the same. The cleric robes were clean. The staff was steady. The eyes were his, but the light in them was not.

"Majesty," he said, "there is a breach. A truth we must see together."

She trusted him the way she had been trained to trust. She followed.

He led her beyond the outer ward, away from the guard rotation, down a hall that should have been sealed. When she realized the door behind her had closed without her word, she reached for command and found only silence. A seal lay over her throat. She felt the restraint like a hand pressed to her mouth. The betrayal landed like a blade in her ribs.

"Grand Maester," she said, voice thin against the ward.

"I am sorry," he said, and for a heartbeat it sounded like him.

He delivered her to the Necrotic King at dusk, in a ruined chapel where the stones still smelled of old prayers and rot. The Necrotic King sat in the collapsed nave, the only throne that had not been meant to be. His eyes were a hollow ice-blue, his breath the slow of a grave. He was not dead. He was worse than dead.

"Queen," he said, smiling as if it were a favor. "You will save your city."

She lifted her chin. "You will not hold me to save yourself."

"I will not need to. You will choose."

Joseph came too late to stop the taking. He reached the chapel as the last of the Grand Maester's seals slid into place. He felt them like a net across the ground. He was not whole. His chest still burned from the last fight. His phalanx did not answer in full. He stepped anyway.

"Release her," he said.

The Necrotic King rose. The chapel's air thickened as if it were water. Joseph's barrier bloomed and cracked. He pushed again. He held. He could not press through. The Necrotic King did not need to strike; he only reached. The force hit Joseph like a wall and threw him across the broken altar, stone shattering under his shoulder.

He tried to rise.

The Grand Maester moved before he could. The staff came down like a judge's gavel, not once but again and again, the weight of it turned cruel by the corruption. Joseph's ribs took the blows. His guard was too slow, his strength too thin. He rolled, he tried to catch the staff, he got only splinters of breath. The Necrotic King stepped in and struck with a hand that was not a hand, a cold force that crushed the air out of Joseph's lungs. The Grand Maester hit him again, and again, and the echo in Joseph staggered toward the end.

He could not fight both. He knew it the moment the third blow landed. He came anyway, because Alexiana was there, because her eyes were on him, because love was the only strength that did not ask for power. He took the punishment and forced himself up, blood on his mouth, a prayer in his throat, and fell again.

Alexiana felt it in her own body. The blows landed in her chest. The sound of bone on stone made her stomach turn. She fought the seal that held her and found only silence. Rage and terror tore at her until her vision tunneled. She wanted to scream his name and could not. She wanted to run and could not. She was forced to watch her husband be broken in front of her, and the grief was so raw it felt like teeth.

Joseph did not rise again.

The Necrotic King turned to her. "Astraea will kneel," he said. "They will send me the Death Knight, or I will bring them the Queen."

He sent his demand by whisper, by captive, by fear. The city heard it before the sun set. The Council called it a choice. Alexiana would have named it extortion if she had been free to speak. The King Consort heard only one word that mattered: Joseph was not dead.

In the council chamber, fear tried to wear the mask of doctrine. Some called for surrender. Some called for a trade. Aelius listened until his jaw went hard. "If we hand him over, we are no longer a realm. We are a possession." He stood and turned his back on them.

Aelius found Joseph in the ruin of the chapel hours later, buried in ash and dust, breath thin but present. He had been the brother left behind; he would not be the brother who failed again. He lifted Joseph with a shoulder, a hand, and a vow that cost him pride. Together they reached the Reliquary.

Joseph's eyes were dim. "She believes me gone," he said.

"Not if we move," Aelius said.

Joseph laughed once, without humor. "We will move. But I will not survive it."

There was a ritual that had only ever been written, never spoken aloud. The Grand Maester had known it. Joseph had found it in the same library that taught him restraint. It was called the Last Oath because it broke the bearer after it was fulfilled.

It did not raise the dead. It did not compel the living. It burned the echo into brightness for one final act, taking the remaining thread in exchange.

He needed a witness. He needed consent.

Aelius stood at his side. "I witness," he said. His voice broke. "And I consent to the cost you choose." He gripped Joseph's shoulder. "Brother."

Joseph touched the floor, traced the circle with blood and frost, and spoke the oath that was not an oath to power but to limit. "Let this end not in dominion. Let it end in choice." The words shook. The room answered.

He looked at Aelius and managed a dry curve of a smile. "Take care of my wife, Consort. Try not to let her win every argument," he said, as if it were a joke that would not live past the hour.

The air changed. The cold did not creep. It snapped. Joseph rose with a weight in him that had been missing for months, something more than full, something that burned at the edges. The echoes answered without strain. The phalanx stood full. The barrier did not tremble.

He did not look back.

The Necrotic King expected a surrender. He got a storm.

Joseph came through the broken chapel wall with the old army at his back, not in a spectacle of control, but in a line of disciplined consent. The echoes formed without a single living pulled. The Necrotic King laughed and reached, a tide of will that had broken armies. The reach broke against Joseph's barrier like surf against stone.

Undead surged. Joseph cut through them with precision, never touching the living, never taking a breath he had not paid for. His blade was not Muramasa's name. It was a vow made steel. He struck once and the Necrotic King's ward split. He struck again and the king bled black across the altar steps. He pressed until the Necrotic King faltered, then fell. When the Necrotic King broke, the cold blue in the Grand Maester's eyes went out as if someone had cut a string.

The hold lifted. The Grand Maester collapsed, a man, not a vessel. Alexiana felt the seal on her throat dissolve. She drew in a breath so sharp it burned, and the first name that left her was his.

Joseph did not stay.

He found her in the collapsing nave, where dust fell like gray snow. He stepped into the light that came in from the shattered roof. His face was already paling. His hands shook, but he held his blade as if it were a promise he could keep.

"You did it," she said.

"We did," he said, and then the strength broke. He went to one knee. She went to him. Her hands were steady even as her throat closed around a grief she had not allowed herself to name.

"I thought you were gone," she said.

"I was," he said, and smiled like a man who had never believed in gentleness until it arrived. "Alexiana, I love you."

The words were simple. They cut deeper than any oath. She caught his face in her hands and held him to her like a vow. "I love you," she said, and did not care who heard it.

"Thank you," he said, eyes locked on hers. "For the honor."

He fell in her arms. The light in him faded. She did not command it back. She did not ask him to stay. She held him until the last breath left, because restraint, in the end, was also mercy.

The Grand Maester stirred behind them, freed and broken. Aelius reached for Alexiana's shoulder. The chapel was quiet in a way that felt like the world had stopped to listen.

The Necrotic King was ash. The Grand Maester was a man again. The city was still standing.

Joseph was gone.

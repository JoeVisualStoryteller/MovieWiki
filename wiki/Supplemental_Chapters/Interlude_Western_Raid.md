## Interlude — Western Raid for Breath

### Context

Placed between ration collapse (Chapter 12) and the bridge strike (Chapter 13). Astraea starves; the council forbids offensive sorties. Joseph disobeys quietly to buy time, using only willing echoes to avoid spending lives and to keep dominion off the table.

### Scene

Council chamber, midnight. The fire had burned down to coals; the room smelled of ash and dry bread. Alexiana’s voice was low and precise. “We do not spend you on grain.” Councilors echoed her. Joseph inclined his head and left. The Grand Maester watched, knowing silence was not agreement.

In the corridor, the Grand Maester stopped Joseph. “Enact the plan,” he said. “Use only willing echoes. No dominion.”

Reliquary gate. Joseph called a lean cadre: archers, a phalanx wedge, a cavalry captain—willing echoes answering from the edge of finality. Consent whispered. Muramasa remained sheathed. He rode west under moon. No living accompanied him.

### Council Fallout

The Grand Maester returned to the chamber. “I approved the raid,” he said. “Joseph has already left.”

Debate ignited. Councilors leaned into the opening: if he could be sent, he could be used. A weapon answered orders; they wanted a chain of command on him and to call it doctrine. Alexiana’s chair ground against stone as she stood. “He is not inventory,” she said. “You will not turn restraint into property.”

The King Consort backed her, voice steady. “If you bind him, you make him a dynasty. If you make him a dynasty, you make him a coup.”

The Grand Maester did not apologize. He laid out his war game without flinching: ration collapse led to citizen deaths; citizen deaths led to revolt; revolt opened the gates; the Necrotic King did not have to breach when they did it for him. He called it necessity. Alexiana called it theft.

A sentry arrived at the doors. “Scouts report: he’s engaged the enemy—undead and living. He’s outnumbered but still pushing forward.” The room went still. Alexiana felt the floor tilt and refused to show it. The thought was a blade kept behind her teeth: he was choosing, and they would try to turn that into command.

The chamber heated. Councilors demanded recall and prosecution. Alexiana and the King Consort pushed back—constraint versus survival, optics versus hunger. The Grand Maester repeated his calculus: the city survived only if Joseph bought time, and time was bought with the only coin Joseph had. Alexiana heard the word “coin” and saw chains. She refused both.

Her voice dropped to a blade. “If he is harmed by a plan you hid from me, I will end you in front of this court.”

The Grand Maester held her gaze and said nothing.

### Target — Logistics Hub

West ridge, near a burned market town. A Necrotic King logistics center: wagons of grain, leather, metal, draft animals penned; overseers were living‑turned, eyes flaring with imposed will. Undead rank‑and‑file stood stacked in rows, dormant until ordered.

### Insertion

Fog hugged the ground. Echo archers picked sentries silently. The phalanx wedge slid through alleys of wagons. Joseph placed cold sigils on gate pins—hinges froze and dropped without a clang. Muramasa stayed unseen; his eyes glowed only long enough to seal the oaths.

### Strike

A living‑turned overseer raised a horn. Joseph reached him in three strides, fist to throat, blade still sheathed. “No choice,” he said—not command, a mercy. The overseer fell; the horn never sounded. Echoes cut the remaining command nodes. Undead stirred, confused without orders. Joseph refused to call more; he accepted messy edges.

### Extraction

Three blue flares rose—pre‑arranged with Astraean scouts shadowing miles back. Wagons creaked as living drivers—woodcutters turned smugglers—rushed in to seize reins. Joseph spoke once: “Do not fight. Do not praise. Move.”

Pursuit formed late—an undead patrol and a few living‑turned stragglers. Joseph used a thin barrier to collapse a small bridge behind the convoy, breath catching. Echo archers slowed the rest. He refused Muramasa.

His vision doubled; he leaned on invisible weight. An echo cavalry captain nodded once, held the line until the convoy was clear, then dissolved with a salute. Joseph staggered but stayed mounted. He did not compel. He spent coherence, not power.

### Sentry Update

A runner reached the chamber, mud to the knee, blood spattered on his sleeve. He dropped to one knee, breathing hard. “He’s secured supplies—grain and wagons—and is fighting while moving them out. They’re still advancing through resistance.”

Another runner staggered in moments later, voice hoarse. “He’s injured—cut down an unholy number, then a living soldier got through and wounded him. Power faltered. He keeps pressing forward. He said, ‘I’m the only one who can do this.’”

Alexiana’s hand curled on the edge of the table. The words landed like a blade, and she did not let the court mistake it for approval. “He is not your property,” she said, louder now. “He is not a lever you pull because you are afraid.”

### Return

Before dawn, wagons rolled through Astraea’s gates. Grain, leather, metal—breath for another year. The city woke to carts piled with sacks, disbelief turning to quiet relief. No heralds; only the smell of flour and horse sweat.

### Confrontation

Reliquary threshold. Alexiana waited, eyes hard. “I forbade this.”

Joseph: “You told me not to be spent. I thought I was following your orders. I paid to keep them eating. No spectacle.”

Grand Maester: “Restraint is not refusal; it is choosing where it lands. I chose the only place the city could survive.”

Joseph: “You know as well as I do—this is not what Death Knights are for. I followed your order. Do not do it again.” His eyes glowed, then dim.

Alexiana’s jaw clenched. “You bled him with a plan you hid and called it duty,” she said to the Grand Maester. “Look at him. This is what your righteousness does.”

She touched Joseph’s shoulder—asking. He nodded. She helped him inside. His fingers tremored. Consent framed the reprimand; restraint framed the rage.

### Doctrine Kept

No living compelled, no dominion practiced, no Death Magic on the living. Supplies taken from an enemy who stripped them first. Ground not held—deterrent doctrine intact: strike, withdraw, do not conquer.

### Fallout

Council seethed at disobedience; the Paladin accuser called it “death worship.” Citizens ate. Alexiana added another mark to the ledger of debts and survivals. Joseph slept like stone, coherence frayed but unbroken.

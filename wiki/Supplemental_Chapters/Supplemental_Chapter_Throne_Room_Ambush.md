# Supplemental Chapter - The Throne Room Ambush (Alexiana POV)

## Placement

Chapter 15ish, alliance talks with East-North and East-South in Astraea's throne room.

## Scene

The delegations arrived with banners folded and faces already set for disagreement. East-North in gray, East-South in red, each flanked by counselors with knives tucked under silk. Their boots tracked dust across Astraea's polished stone. The air smelled of old stone, ink, and candle smoke that never quite left the hall.

The crown pinched. The long braid at Alexiana's nape felt heavier than iron. She kept her shoulders back anyway, breathing in counts she did not let anyone hear.

Alexiana sat on the high seat with Aelius at her right, her parents a half-step behind the dais, the council ranged in a crescent that left no empty space. Joseph stood at her left as Honor Guard, black and still. The Paladin accuser stood at Aelius's shoulder, hand at his hilt, a wall of judgment made flesh.

"Your borders are the ones that collapsed," East-North's lead envoy said, voice sharp. "Do not ask us to bleed for your walls."

East-South's envoy leaned forward. "We already have. The Necrotic King gutted our command and you hid behind your doctrine. We are rebuilding. You want men we do not have."

Her father lifted his chin. "We sent aid when we could. We held the line that kept your cities standing at all."

Her mother spoke calmly, as if calming a storm. "You want terms? So do we. We are not asking for fealty. We are asking for a reason to stand together while the ground shakes under us."

The council murmured, a brief, cutting chorus. "We cannot commit to terms that gut our stores." "We cannot let Astraea become the only wall." "If you are rebuilding, you need us as much as we need you."

Aelius's voice was measured. "We do not need allies who will break when the first shadow falls."

The Paladin accuser nodded once, cold. "Holy orders will not march at the command of Death Knights."

Joseph did not move. His gaze never left the room, never left the angles above it. Alexiana felt him register the ceiling ribs, the seams, the quiet paths no courtier ever named. Her spine stayed straight. Her jaw set. The inside of her cheek tasted of copper where she had bitten it to keep her voice level.

She held the copper taste as if it were a promise: no tremor, no weakness, not with these eyes on her.

Alexiana felt the tension string itself tight. "We do not ask your orders to bend to ours. We ask for bodies, provisions, and a unified line that does not fracture the moment the Necrotic King chooses a point."

"And what do we get?" East-North's envoy asked. "Your gratitude after we leave?"

She opened her mouth to answer, and the air shifted. A chill that did not belong to winter slipped under her skin. Joseph's hand tightened around the hilt at his side, once, then released.

He moved.

Her heart dropped and she did not let it show.

He crossed the space between them in a breath, turned as if to guide her away from the dais, and pulled her into him. His arm came around her, broad and armored, the gesture a shield, not a promise. To the room it read as guard and Queen. To Alexiana it was the only wall between her and a storm she had not yet seen.

The first arrow hit his back and punched through the seam. The second struck lower, glancing off rib and sinking. The third found the space between plate and shoulder. The impacts thudded like hammers into iron. Warmth splashed along her sleeve. The arrowheads were black with oil; the stench of poison cut through incense. She felt each one as if it struck her own ribs.

The sound was wrong for a throne room: wet, metallic, final.

He did not flinch. His weight took hers backward, away from the line of the dais, his body between her and the falling storm.

"Down," he said, the word for her and for the room.

Guards moved. The royal defense line snapped into place. Councilors were dragged behind steel and bodies. The Paladin accuser stepped in front of Aelius without being asked, his light flaring. Her parents were pulled toward the inner wall, her mother still speaking as she was moved, as if words could hold the room together.

Joseph took a knee. The sound of his armor on stone was a bell. He set his palm to the ground and cast a barrier around Alexiana as he fell, a thin ring of cold that hummed and held. His hand trembled once and he forced it still. Frost crawled over the edge of the dais. The air inside the ring tightened, dense and still. Arrows met it and dropped with dull, wet clicks at her feet.

The cold bit her teeth. Her breath fogged, trapped with her in the circle.

Arrows split the air again. He rose into them. Three more sank into his chest, the impact rocking him backward without stopping his stride. He moved forward, head lifted, eyes tracking the ceiling's ribs, the dark seams where the secret paths met the hall.

Alexiana's throat closed. "Joseph--"

She did not beg. She did not command. The word was all she could give.

He did not look back. He could not. The barrier held around her, around the throne, around the people she had to keep breathing.

Another volley. He took them in his legs and arms, a stagger that became a step. Blood ran in dark lines along his greaves. He lifted his hand toward the rafters and called a death strike. The air went cold and thin. The ceiling tore open with a crack like bone. The hidden passage collapsed in a shower of stone and shadow. A body fell from the breach, limp before it hit the floor.

The crack echoed through her ribs.

Then his knees gave.

Joseph hit the floor hard, and the barrier dissolved with him, the cold ring flickering out as his breath finally broke.

The sound snapped the hall. It snapped her.

Alexiana moved before the guards could stop her. She dropped to her knees at his side, her hands on his chestplate, feeling the wet warmth under iron. The arrow shafts stood out like black reeds. Her mouth tasted of copper. The world thinned to the sound of his breathing and the hiss of arrows still being plucked from the stone.

Her hands shook. She kept them steady anyway.

She did not touch him like a lover. She touched him like a Queen counting the cost of her wall. Her palm pressed his breastplate, checking the rise, the fall, the beat.

She looked up at the delegations, at her council, at the Paladin who had just watched a Death Knight bleed for a Queen he was forbidden to love. "Seal the room," she said, voice low and steady. "Find the dead. No one leaves."

Her father was already issuing orders to the guard. Her mother stood still, eyes on Joseph, grief and resolve woven tight. East-North's envoy had gone pale. East-South's envoy gripped the edge of the table as if it were a lifeline.

And then Alexiana looked back down at Joseph, and her restraint broke in her ribs where no one could see it.

For a breath she thought he would not rise again.

Healers rushed in with satchels and cloth, hands already red from other rooms. One knelt, fingers at his throat, then at his wrist, then at the arrows in his chest. "He's breathing," the healer said, disbelief threaded through her voice. "Shallow. Still breathing."

The smell of antiseptic cut through blood and smoke.

Joseph's eyes opened, dim and unfocused. He did not sit up. His mouth opened once and a wet cough tore out of him. Blood spattered his own armor and the hem of Alexiana's dress. She flinched and stayed.

The stain spread dark and hot, and she did not wipe it away.

Cold gathered in the hall. Not from the open breach, but from him.

The hair on her arms lifted. The air tasted like iron and winter.

The floor darkened. The air tightened. A ring of frost crawled out from under his palms like a slow answer. Figures rose at the edges of the dais, twelve shapes in black and ash, helms bowed, hands open. Death Knights, echoes given form. No banners. No parade. Just silence and the weight of what he had never done in battle.

Frost webbed their armor. The light dimmed around them as if the hall itself stepped back.

A councilor cried out and stumbled back. East-North's envoy went white. East-South's envoy gripped the table as if it were the only thing keeping him upright. The Paladin accuser's light flared, then faltered. He stared as if doctrine had just split in two.

Alexiana's breath caught. Joseph had never summoned like this in front of the court. Even she recoiled, one step back, the cold from his spell licking her skin. For a heartbeat she wondered if the pain had pushed him over the edge, if he had gone to a place she could not follow. She felt the room tilt.

She wanted him to look at her. He did not.

Joseph lifted his head, eyes still glassed, voice ragged. "Find the other three," he said. "Do not kill them. Bring them to me."

The words came out like gravel, like a vow dragged over stone.

The words landed and unlocked a memory she had sealed away: a younger Alexiana on a palace floor, an assassin pinned under Joseph's knee, his blade held still at her order. He had asked then, "Command me." She had said, "Live. For testimony." The same restraint. The same refusal to take what he could.

She stepped back to him. The fear did not leave, but it made room. She dropped to her knees again, hand on his chestplate, counting his breaths. "I'm here," she said, low. The words were for him and for herself.

The death knights moved without sound, dispersing through the hall and into the passages above. Their silence was worse than a shout. Guards swallowed and followed at a distance. The council watched, no longer debating terms, no longer pretending to be the wall.

She saw East-North's hands trembling. She saw East-South's envoy stare at Joseph like a man seeing stormlight for the first time.

The healers worked around Alexiana's hands, sliding cloth beneath armor, snapping arrow shafts, pressing pressure where they could reach. Joseph coughed again, blood dark and thick. It streaked her sleeve. She did not wipe it away.

Each cough sounded like it could be the last.

"Stay with me," she said, not as an order but as a plea she would not allow the room to hear. He did not answer. He kept breathing.

The Grand Maester entered without ceremony, rain on his cloak, staff striking stone in a hard rhythm. He took in the arrows, the blood, the summons, and his mouth thinned.

The room seemed to shrink around him.

"Hmph," he said. "I trained you better than that. Get up."

The room went still. Alexiana felt the insult land like a slap across Joseph's ribs. It was cruelty in front of court and council, meant to remind everyone who had made him. Her fingers curled, but she did not move.

Joseph pushed a palm against the floor and rose. The motion was slow, deliberate, disciplined. Blood ran from the broken seams, dark and steady, pooling on the stone. Any living man would have been dead on that floor. He hauled himself upright anyway, breath thin, shoulders shaking once before he forced them still. He called on his training, the drilled stillness in the center of pain. He did not look at the Grand Maester. He did not answer.

The blood reached the Grand Maester's boots and he did not step back.

The Grand Maester's jaw tightened, but he said nothing more.

From the passage above, the Death Knights returned. They came silent as shadows, dragging one woman between them. Her wrists were bound, her face smeared with soot, eyes bright with fear and refusal. There was no blood on her; they had obeyed.

Her gaze found Alexiana and held, full of hunger and hate.

Joseph's gaze caught her. Recognition flashed, then held. Alexiana felt the memory strike him: a riverbank, a peace convoy, her parents under attack, Joseph's hand closing around this woman's wrist as she drove a blade for the King. He had spared her then. She had tried again.

"Two escaped," one of the death knights reported, voice flat. "This one remained."

Joseph nodded once, the smallest movement he could afford. Blood slipped from his mouth and down his chin. He wiped it with the back of his gauntlet and still did not fall.

He lifted his gaze to the dais. "This is one of the dissenters from the peace convoy," he said, voice low but carrying. "The one who struck at the King that day."

The room shifted. Her father's hand tightened on the arm of his chair. Her mother's mouth went still.

Alexiana rose. Her voice held steel. "You remember me."

Her hands trembled at her sides. She let no one see it.

The woman spat blood onto the stone. "I remember the boy who let me live."

Joseph did not move. Alexiana stepped closer, her shadow falling over the bound assassin. "Why did you come back," she asked, "after mercy?"

The woman's eyes flicked to Joseph, then back to Alexiana. "Because mercy does not feed the dead," she said. "Because your peace starved ours."

Murmurs cut through the hall. The East-North envoy stiffened. The East-South envoy looked away.

Alexiana straightened. "You chose the Necrotic King."

The words were not a question. They were a verdict.

The woman bared her teeth. "We chose anyone who would burn your treaties."

Alexiana's jaw set. "Take her," she said. "Interrogation. Live. No dominion."

She turned before the court could see the shake in her hands.

Joseph's breath hitched. The healers were already at his side. He gestured once to the death knights.

His fingers shook. He forced them still.

"Dismissed," he said.

The twelve echoes bowed and dissolved back into ash, the cold in the room lifting as if a tide had ebbed. Joseph swayed, then steadied himself on the healer's shoulder.

The sudden warmth felt wrong, like an exposed wound.

Alexiana watched him go. He did not look back. He went with the healers to the Reliquary, each step a decision, each breath a cost.

Her crown felt heavier than ever.

The Paladin accuser's voice cut across the hall. "You do not get to make judgments in this chamber. You are a weapon, not a voice."

Alexiana lifted a hand, palm out in command, her mother mirroring the gesture from the dais. "Paladin, hold," Alexiana began.

"Not now," her mother warned, softer but edged.

Joseph lifted two fingers. The healers stopped.

He was barely upright; the gesture still stilled the room.

He did not turn. He did not give the Paladin the grace of his face. His reply was simple, the kind that left no room for sermon.

"Your oath magic failed you that day," he said. "You would have lost both of them and left Alexiana parentless if it weren't for me. I saved your oath."

The room held its breath.

The Grand Maester stepped forward, staff tapping once. "A Paladin who loses his charge has little room in council," he said, voice even. "Remember where you stand."

The Paladin accuser went still, fury banked, the rebuke public and clean.

Joseph lowered his hand. The healers moved. He left the room without another word.

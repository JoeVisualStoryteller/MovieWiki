# Supplemental Chapter - The Trial of Vows

## Placement

After the secret wedding is discovered, before the final collapse of the war. This is a political and emotional rupture that forces the doctrine into the open.

## Scene

The Council found the sealed vows and called them treason. They called the marriage a breach of doctrine and a threat to the realm. They called me and the King Consort compromised, and they called it mercy to drag us to trial instead of the block.

It was not a trial. It was a verdict looking for ceremony, and I could feel it in the way they would not meet my eyes.

The Paladin accuser led oath-men to find Joseph. The kill squad came back empty-handed, their silence loud enough to tell me they had been given orders written in blood. No one said Joseph's name in the hall. That hurt worse than the rope.

They staged the court in the old hall, where the beams still held the scent of oaths. I stood with my hands bound. The King Consort stood beside me, jaw set, eyes hard. The Council read the charges. The Paladin spoke of purity and law. The Grand Maester stood among them, face down, silent.

"A monarch cannot bind to death," the Paladin said. "That vow makes the realm a possession. It dresses dominion in romance."

"Doctrine exists to protect the living from the dead," a councilor said. "If the Queen can set it aside, then no vow can stand."

"You fear power you cannot command," Aelius said. "So you call consent a crime."

"A monarch is not a private citizen," the Paladin replied. "The realm is her body politic. She cannot wed death without sentencing us all."

"The doctrine is consent," another councilor said. "She has broken it."

"We consented," Aelius said. "You are the ones stripping it from us."

I answered once. "Restraint does not mean obedience to a lie." They cut me off and called it confession.

The verdict fell. Execution at dusk. A public hanging to remind the city where the law lived.

They stripped us of crown and cloak. They stripped us of rings and titles. They stripped us of the small dignities the law pretended to honor. They marched us through the streets with ropes on our wrists and the crowd pressed in, hungry for either justice or spectacle.

I walked barefoot on cold stone. My spine stayed straight. My mouth tasted of copper where I had bitten the inside of my cheek. I did not look for mercy. I looked for Joseph and did not see him. That hurt more than the rope.

The square was full. The scaffold waited. The executioner checked the knots. The Paladin lifted a hand for silence.

Joseph stood in the square, hood down, a shadow in open day. He met my eyes once. The rope fell away inside my chest. I felt his love like a hand at my back, and it steadied me even as the noose slipped around my neck.

The world narrowed to the hemp against my skin and the rasp of it against my pulse. I counted the breaths I had left and hated myself for counting. I tasted iron and remembered the first time I had told him no, the first time I had said yes, the first time I had asked him to stay. My throat tried to close; the seal held it open. My body wanted to fight, to flee, to command. I had none of those choices. All I could do was stand and refuse to break.

I told myself this would be fast, that pain was a thin thing compared to what the realm demanded. I told myself the doctrine would hold even as it killed me. I did not believe it. Under the fear was a primal plea I could not voice: not here, not like this, not without him. I let the plea burn in my chest and turned it into a promise I could keep -- if he lived, I would not flinch again.

The executioner stepped in.

His hands were huge, raw at the knuckles. They smelled of tallow and iron. He coiled the rope with practiced indifference, the fibers rough against his palms. He slid the noose under my jaw, thumb pressing the knot into the hollow beneath my ear, and pulled it tight. The rope creaked; I felt the small shift of the beam above me, the weight of the scaffold taking my body as a measure.

My breath shortened. One inhale. Two. The noose kissed my throat and stole the next. My lungs fought for air that was not there. I swallowed and felt the rope grind. The world narrowed to the rasp of hemp and the pressure against the artery. I counted three heartbeats and thought, not like this.

Joseph released the full weight of Death Magic.

It was not a spell so much as a verdict on the air. Cold dropped through the square like a sudden winter. The breath went out of every living throat at once. Eyes rolled back. Knees buckled. Weapons fell and clattered across stone. A guard hit the scaffold rail and split his brow; his teeth clicked on wood. A woman in the crowd bit her tongue and collapsed with blood on her chin. A man fell face-first on the cobbles and lay with a cheek scraped raw. The Paladin's oath-glow guttered and died. Horses dropped to their knees, tack snapping under the weight; a saddle struck stone hard enough to crack a buckle. The crowd crumpled into silence, unconscious, spared. Joseph kept his power on a hairline edge, enough to still them, not to steal them.

He caught me before my knees could hit the boards. He cut the rope with a blade that shook in his hand. He freed the King Consort and lifted us both as if we weighed nothing at all.

He left the city without noise.

He took us to the place he called a home in his own mind, though it had never been one. The stone cells lay under a hill, old and damp, the walls still scarred by the Grand Maester's drills. The air smelled of iron and old water. It was the place that had broken him and made him, and it was the only place he trusted to keep us hidden.

When the spell faded, I woke first. The ropes were gone. Linen covered my shoulders. Joseph sat across from me, hands still, a bowl of water at his side. The King Consort lay wrapped in a cloak, breath steady.

"You should be running," I whispered.

"I am," he said. "Toward you."

I reached for him, and he stopped just long enough to search my eyes. "May I?" he asked. The words were hoarse and careful.

"Yes," I said, and pulled him into me, my mouth finding his before my fear could catch up. He kissed me as if it were an oath, slow and reverent, his hands trembling against my waist. I slid my fingers into his hair and held him there, my husband, real and warm, while I drank the smoke and salt of him. I climbed into his lap and felt the shudder he tried to hide. My mouth found the cut at his lip and I kissed it, tasting iron. My hands slid under his tunic, over scars and heat, and he let me. He touched me with permission, palms on my hips, then higher; I guided his hand to my breast and felt his breath break. I wanted him inside me, wanted to take him so deep the world would disappear, but we were still bleeding and Aelius slept three steps away. I kept it at the edge—kisses, hands, the vow of it—and it was enough to make my knees go weak. "Stay," I whispered. He did. In the corner, Aelius slept, turned away, his back a small mercy.

I drew him down with me onto the pallet, my mouth at his ear. "Quiet," I breathed, and felt him nod against my throat. I slid his tunic up and reached for him, guiding him with a slow, steady hand. He was hard in my palm, hot and heavy, and I stroked him once, twice, watching his throat work as he fought to stay silent. "Tell me if you want me to stop," I said. His answer was a broken sound and a hand on my hip, anchoring me.

I spread my thighs and touched myself, slick and aching, then guided his cock to me. I sank down slowly, inch by inch, until he filled my cunt and I had to close my eyes to keep from making noise. The stretch burned into relief. I braced my hands on his chest, feeling the tremor under my palms, and started to move. Quiet, deep, deliberate. My pace set the rhythm. His hands followed where I asked, fingers sliding under my hips to lift me, to meet me, to keep me steady. The world narrowed to the heat between us and the pressure of his mouth against my shoulder as I took him deeper, letting the tremor in my body turn into need.

He held back for me. I felt it in the way he gripped my waist, in the way his breath stuttered as I rode him, quiet and relentless. I dragged his hand down between us and pressed his fingers to my clit; he circled me there, slow at first, then harder, until I had to bite my lip to stay silent. I kissed him to keep the sound inside us, tasting blood and salt, and let the tension build where it wanted to.

I slid off him, breath shaking, and turned, lowering myself onto him again facing away. His cock filled me from a different angle, deeper, and I rode him with both hands braced on his thighs. He bit his knuckle to keep quiet. I reached back, caught his hand, and pressed it to my breast, then to the place between my legs where I needed him most.

I leaned forward and let him take me on my side, my back to his chest. He slid into me from behind, slow and careful, his mouth at my shoulder, his hand between my thighs. The pressure was different, fuller, and I chased it, rocking back until my breath turned ragged. When I pulled him over me and wrapped my legs around his waist, he thrust in short, quiet strokes, his face buried against my neck so the sound would not carry.

When he finally came, he did it with my name against my skin, and I followed him, biting the inside of my cheek to stay silent. I stayed on him until the shaking passed, my forehead against his, my hands in his hair, keeping him close enough to believe he was real.

I eased him out of me and held him while he went soft. I cleaned him with the edge of my cloak, slow and careful, and he did the same for me, his touch asking each time. I kissed the cut at his lip, then the bruise on his jaw. "Are you hurt?" he whispered.

"Only where they couldn't reach," I said, and pressed my mouth to his throat until his breath steadied. We lay tangled on the pallet, his hand on my belly, mine on his chest, listening to each other breathe while Aelius slept in the corner, turned away.

We stayed like that until the tremor in my chest eased. I kept my forehead against his and memorized the shape of his breath. I pressed my mouth to his throat and listened to his heartbeat answer mine.

He cleaned the rope burns with care, never touching without asking. He bound my wrists with bandage and patience. He fed the King Consort water and watched him swallow. He stayed awake all night with his back to the wall, listening for boots that did not come.
I slept with my hand on his chest, counting each rise until the panic let me go.

Morning filtered in gray. Joseph did not leave. He washed blood from my feet. He warmed bread in a pan and cut it into small pieces so my hands would not have to work. He did the same for Aelius, then sat with his head against the stone, eyes open, waiting.

The Grand Maester arrived at midday. The air went colder. I wanted his throat in my hands. I wanted his vows torn out and laid at his feet. I wanted him to feel, for one hour, what he had done to Joseph for years.

He stepped into the cell like a man who had never been away. His staff tapped once on the floor. His face was calm, the calm of a man who had decided the cost long ago. I felt the truth of it before a word was spoken, and it was betrayal.

"You told them," Joseph said.

"I told the law," the Grand Maester replied. "You broke it. The realm cannot be held by a secret vow."

"You think this is about vows?" he said, and his voice went cold. "He was meant for you, Alexiana. The betrothal was sealed before you wore a crown. I took him from the line and made him what the realm needed."

The words hit like a blade. "You stole him," I said.

"You stole my brother," Aelius said, the color leaving his face. "Joseph is—"

"Justian Vale," the Grand Maester said. "Your brother. The one your house buried in silence. I erased the name and forged the deterrent."

Joseph went still. I felt his breath catch, felt the old wound open in the room.

"You broke consent before I even knew his name," I said. My voice was ice. "You broke my marriage before it existed. You made a weapon out of a man and called it duty."

"I did what the realm required," he said. "You both benefited from the order I created."

"No," I said. "We survived you. We did not owe you."

He smiled without warmth. "You want the rest? I made him in a cell that never saw sun. I held his head under water until black dots ate his sight and he stopped fighting. I hung weights from his arms until the joints tore and set them back while he screamed. I kept him awake for nights, screaming oaths until his voice bled; when it failed, I poured cold water over his head and began again. I put him in ice until his lips went blue and his teeth chattered raw and called it discipline. I broke his bones and set them without mercy. I cut him and packed salt into the wounds. I chained him to the floor until his legs shook, then beat him for falling. I fed him pain and told him it was holy."

My stomach turned. Bile surged up and I gagged, swallowing it back until my throat burned. The room tilted. My hands shook so hard my nails cut into my palms. If my legs had held me, I would have killed him with my own hands. The rope burns and bruises kept me rooted, fury burning hot and useless in my chest. I was not a queen in that moment. I was a woman who loved a man and had been forced to watch him be made into a weapon.

Joseph lifted a hand. The room quieted. Even the Grand Maester paused.

"I was taught all of it," Joseph said, voice flat with old memory. "Attack. Defense. Summon. No Death Knight is given all three. I was, because he wanted me to carry the Order itself, an oath that no longer exists. It was never about consent. It was about control."

He looked at the Grand Maester. "When he saw what Alexiana and I were, he sent me into exile to die. When I didn't, he turned the court against her."

I wanted to spit in his face. I wanted to split his skull with his own staff. I wanted him dead more than I had ever wanted any enemy dead.

Joseph rose. Aelius and I pushed to our feet, but Joseph lifted a hand, a silent request to stay. I obeyed, even as every muscle in my body begged to move.

The Grand Maester lifted his staff. "This ends with me," he said.

Joseph turned to him. "I swore to the Council and the court you do not want to see what happens when I am compelled. You are about to find out, Grand Maester."

"No," I said, shocked. "You don't have to do this for me."

He looked at me once. "I almost lost you. I consent not to lose you again."

It did. The first Death Knight and the last met in the place that had made them both, and the cell became their arena.

The Grand Maester struck first. The staff cracked across Joseph's ribs, then his jaw. Something gave in his chest; he coughed blood that spattered the stones. The sound went through me and lodged behind my teeth. I took a step and Aelius caught my arm. I screamed at the Grand Maester, words ripping out of me. "Stop. Stop!" The next blow split Joseph's lip and turned his smile into red. I screamed again, raw and shaking. "You made him. You do not get to break him." A third clipped his temple and sparked white behind his eyes. "You fucking traitor," I shouted. "Put it down." A fourth opened Joseph's shoulder, linen splitting, blood slicking down his arm. A fifth took his knee; he hit the stone, cheek grinding against grit, then forced himself up on a breath that tasted of iron. "If he dies, I will end you myself," I said, voice gone ragged. He did not draw Muramasa. He did not call the dead. He closed the distance and took the blows as if they were penance. I wanted to tear the Grand Maester apart with my hands and could not move.

The Grand Maester drew a blade from his sleeve and drove it into Joseph's side, then twisted. Blood darkened the linen. I made a sound I did not recognize and pressed my palm to my own ribs as if it could stop the wound. "Enough," I shouted, and my voice broke. "If there is a god left in you, stop." He pulled the blade free and struck again, low, where a mortal would have fallen. "Look at him," I screamed. "Look at what you did." Joseph's breath hitched and came back in a wet rasp. He kept coming, staggering, teeth bared, eyes locked on the old man. The blade found his gut and he folded, then rose again, reaching, leaving a smear of blood across the stones as if he were dragging the night with him. The Grand Maester hit him with the hilt, snapped his head to the side, then cut across his back, the line of blood opening like a mouth. I wanted to scream Joseph's name and tear the sound out of my throat.

Joseph stumbled into the wall, steadied himself with a hand that left a print. The Grand Maester pressed in, struck the same ribs again, and I heard the crack in his body. I tasted bile and kept my feet. He dropped and rose, dropped and rose, counting breaths he could not afford. I hated the Grand Maester so fiercely I shook.

Any living man would have died on the stones. Joseph only grunted and stepped closer. It was not power that moved him, not alone. It was love. It was the memory of the scaffold. It was the vow he had made in the dark.

Joseph caught the staff with one hand, splinters biting his palm. He broke it across his knee. He stepped in, took the Grand Maester's wrist, and turned the blade back on him. He ended it with steel and his own hands, no spell, no echo. The Grand Maester fell like a man who had waited for this moment. I felt no pity, only a cold that would not lift.

The cell went quiet.

Joseph dropped to his knees. Blood ran down his arm. He looked at me and could not hide the tremor in his voice.

"Forgive me," he said. "For this. For bringing you here. For making you watch."

I went to him and took his face in my hands. I kissed his mouth, tasted blood, and held him there until his tremor eased. My hands slid to his throat, to his chest, needing the proof of him. "There is nothing to forgive," I said. "You did nothing wrong."

The King Consort stood beside me and nodded once, the gesture small and absolute.

Joseph closed his eyes. He leaned into my palm. The vow held. The world did not end, but something inside it had changed.

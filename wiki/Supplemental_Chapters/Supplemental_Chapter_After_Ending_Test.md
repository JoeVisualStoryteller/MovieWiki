# Supplemental Chapter — After the Ending (Alexiana POV)

I was still standing when the silence finally arrived.

He had done it in front of everyone—on the field, in the light, with the living on the walls. The Necrotic King was dusting away in the wind, and Joseph was still on his feet only because he had not decided to fall. The air smelled of ash and copper. My tongue tasted of iron; I had bitten it to keep from crying out when the tether snapped.

I crossed the open ground without waiting for permission. The crowd opened a corridor, eyes fixed on him, on the place where a god had just died like a man. When I reached him, he swayed, and I put my hand to his breastplate. The black light behind his eyes flickered and went dull.

“Say the word,” he whispered, voice raw. “If you ask it.”

“Rest,” I said, and that was the only order I gave him.

He folded into me as if the world had been holding him upright by the collar and had just let go. His weight was terrible and familiar. I felt the truth of it in my bones: he was not a weapon, not an emblem, not a rumor. He was a man who had chosen restraint one more time than any man should have to.

We took him in under the quiet of the Reliquary. The stone was cold, and so was he. The Grand Maester closed the doors. I watched the frost trace his skin; it had always been the mark of his cost. When he reached for the phalanx that had answered him before, only a few rose. The larger call did not answer. He closed his eyes, and the loss settled into him like a second blade.

He needed healing, but he needed protection more.

The Council came with fear and gratitude, with plans to name him a tool or erase him as a risk. I met them at the threshold before they could reach the lower hall. I stood between them and the door and made the question simple.

“He saved the realm. He will not be paraded for your comfort.”

They spoke of precedent, of optics, of a throne that could not be bound to death. I listened, then ended the audience without a vote. The law was a blade in my voice, and I used it to cut their reach short.

By nightfall, his breath had steadied. The glow did not return.

“You need the physician,” I said.

“I need your word,” he said.

I did not pretend not to understand.

In the Reliquary, we spoke no names until the door sealed. The rites were simple, the air heavy. The Grand Maester kept his eyes low. He asked for consent. We said yes. Those were the only words that mattered.

I set the terms. He waited. That waiting was the first vow.

There was no crown, no court, no trumpet. There was a band of plain metal, cold from the stone, warmed by our hands. I touched his knuckles and saw the tremor in them. He had held the world with those hands; now he let them be held.

“You are not a weapon,” I said.

“And I am not your possession,” he said, steady.

“Only by consent,” I answered.

We bound the vows to silence. The Grand Maester spoke the finality rite, and then he left us.

I led Joseph to the bed. The lamp burned low; rain whispered against the stone. I slipped the linen cord around his wrists, loose and gentle. “Tell me if it’s too much.”

“It’s not,” he said. “Keep it.”

“Good,” I said.

I guided him to his knees. “Mouth.”

He looked up. “May I?”

“Yes.”

He kissed me with a reverence that made my breath break. I set my hand in his hair and held him there, letting him worship until my body shook. When I pulled him up, he came willingly, eyes fixed on mine.

I pushed him back onto the bed and climbed over him, the linen slack but present, a reminder and a promise. I lowered myself onto him slowly, feeling the tremor in his breath ease into a steady rhythm. He let me set the pace, take what I asked for and no more. When I told him to look at me, he did. Each word was a blade and a balm.

He came with my name on his mouth, and I followed him, biting back a cry as the world narrowed to him and the press of his hands against my hips. I loosened the cord, rubbed the marks from his wrists, and held his face between my palms until his shaking passed. He pressed his forehead to mine and stayed.

We did not make a spectacle of the night or claim victory. We chose a truth we would keep hidden so the realm could breathe. When I gave him permission to rest, it was not indulgence. It was a restraint I could carry for him.

In the morning, there were messengers. The city was sweeping ash from its streets. The paladins began their chants of thanksgiving. The Council announced a day of mourning and a day of rebuilding. They never mentioned his name.

He walked the rampart with me at dusk, a hood over his eyes. We did not hold hands where anyone could see. He watched the smoke lift, the first ships returning, the fields beyond the wall that would need planting. I listened to the heartbeat I had asked him to keep.

“How long will it last?” he asked.

“As long as we choose,” I said.

We went back to work. That was the last and truest vow.

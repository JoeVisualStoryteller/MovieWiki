## Interlude — Death Knight vs Paladin

### Placement

Fits after Chapter 14’s rising doctrinal tension, before the siege tightens (Chapters 17–18). Can be referenced later during the accuser’s trial push.

### Scene

Dawn bled pale light across the cloistered training yard. Mist slicked the stone; the air tasted of wet iron and old incense. Alexiana sanctioned the bout to settle doctrine without sermons, and the city felt it even without a crowd. Guards stood at the gates, denying entry, yet whispers threaded the corridors.

The Paladin accuser arrived in ceremonial plate, Oath Magic simmering in his joints. His blade glowed pale gold, making the fog recoil. Joseph came helmetless, Muramasa unsummoned, matte armor drinking light. His breath frosted once, then steadied. His hands were empty.

“You cannot love a queen and wield death,” the Paladin said. “Choose.”

“I already did,” Joseph answered. “Restraint.”

They circled. The Paladin struck first, a brutal overhead cut meant to break bone. Joseph caught the blade in a gauntlet and slid it aside, the impact ringing through the yard like a bell. He did not counter. He stepped, angled, let the force pass him. Restraint was his footwork.

“Show them your true nature,” the Paladin snarled.

“Restraint is my nature.”

The Paladin invoked Oaths of Purity. His blade brightened, the air humming with righteous heat. Joseph let the strike go wide, then thickened the air at the Paladin’s feet—a cold drag that slowed without binding. The Paladin stumbled, furious, and drove a second blow toward Joseph’s shoulder. Steel kissed flesh; blood beaded hot in the cold. Alexiana inhaled once, hard, and kept her face still.

Joseph’s eyes flared, then dimmed. He refused Muramasa.

The Paladin feinted high and snapped low. Joseph pivoted, twisted his wrist, and locked the Paladin’s blade arm. Instead of breaking it, he breathed cold into the metal and froze the hilt to the gauntlet. Frost crawled blue-white along gold. The Paladin’s Oath Magic flickered against the ice.

“Yield,” Joseph said. “Consent matters even here.”

“I do not yield to death,” the Paladin spat.

“Then yield to your Queen,” Joseph said without raising his voice.

Alexiana stepped forward. Her boots clicked once on the wet stone. “Yield.”

It was not dominion, but command—clean and lawful. The Paladin’s jaw clenched. He bowed, fury burning behind his eyes. The word was spoken. The bout ended.

The Grand Maester thawed the blade with a breath. The Paladin stalked out, sermon unborn, grievance hardened into a weapon for later courts. In the shadows, soldiers exchanged glances: Death Magic restrained, Oath Magic checked.

Joseph’s hand slicked on his gauntlet. His breath hitched. He did not let the tremor show until the yard emptied. Alexiana stepped close; her palm hovered. He nodded once, and she steadied him.

He had won without killing. The doctrine held. The accuser’s rage did not.

### Fallout Hook

The Paladin accuser escalates politically, unable to win in combat. He adds “public duel” to his list of grievances, fueling the later trial threat. The rank‑and‑file carry another story: the Death Knight chose not to kill when he could have. Faith fractures along that line.

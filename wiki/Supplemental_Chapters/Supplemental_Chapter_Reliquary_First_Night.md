# Supplemental Chapter - The Reliquary First Night

## Placement

After the Trial of Vows and the restoration of the Crown's authority. First night back in power, when the public fiction is restored and the private bond can breathe.

## Scene

The palace had gone quiet in the way a city does after a storm, when the air still tastes of iron and everyone pretends the damage is contained. The Council had bowed again. The crown sat where it belonged. The fiction had been mended with patience and threat. I wore the weight of it in my shoulders and kept my spine straight anyway.

I left Aelius to his rooms with a promise of sleep I did not intend to keep. The Reliquary called me more honestly than the bed did. Its corridors were colder, its silence a kind of truth. The map room was lit by one candle. Joseph sat at the table, reading as if the war could be solved by lines on a page. He did not wear his helm. His gauntlets were off. The book trembled in his hands.

He looked up when I entered. The tremor did not stop. He set the book down with care, as if it were a blade.

"You should rest," I said.

"So should you," he answered. The corner of his mouth moved, almost a smile.

I closed the door and barred it. The iron slid home with a low, final sound. Joseph lifted a hand and the ward flared, a thin, clear skin over the stone. The air pressed back, as if the room itself agreed to keep us.

"We're alone?" I asked.

He nodded. "By my consent."

"Good." I crossed the room and took his hands in mine. He was warm in the places that mattered, cold in the places the magic had leeched. The tremor ran under my fingers.

"It's still there," I said.

"It doesn't leave just because the Council bowed," he said.

I lifted his knuckles to my mouth. "I am not trying to erase it."

He watched me closely. "What are you trying to do?"

I breathed out. "Remember you as a man, not a deterrent. Remember me as a woman, not a verdict."

He swallowed once. "May I?"

"Yes," I said, and guided him down to the chair. I sat on the table edge and untied the leather cord that held the maps. It was soft, used. I looped it around his wrists, loose enough to slip two fingers between the knot and his skin.

"Too tight?" I asked.

"No," he said, steady. "Keep it."

"If it changes, you tell me."

"I will."

I slid off the table and stood between his knees. "Mouth," I said, and his eyes darkened with the word. He leaned forward, stopped at the line of my skirt.

"May I?" he asked again.

"Yes."

He kissed me the way he always did, as if it were an oath, slow and reverent. I let the heat of it settle in my chest. My hands went to his hair and held him there. I could feel the tremor in his fingers even with his wrists bound. It did not frighten me. It grounded me.

I drew back and undid the buttons at my throat. The fabric slid from my shoulders. He watched, breathing through his nose, waiting for my next word.

"Stay," I murmured.

He stayed.

I straddled his lap and felt him hard against my thigh. I lifted myself and settled over him, slow enough to feel every inch, enough to make him close his eyes. The first press was a quiet burn, then relief. I set the pace with my hips. He could not move unless I let him. It was a comfort, not a punishment. It made us both steadier.

"May I touch you?" he asked, voice low against my throat.

"Yes. Here." I guided his bound hands to my breasts and let him press his palms there, careful, reverent. The cord moved as he did, loose and obedient.

"Quiet," I breathed, and felt him nod against my skin.

I rocked slowly, a rhythm that asked for patience. The candle hissed. The ward hummed. The world outside could do what it wanted; the room belonged to us. I slid his hand between my legs and kept it there, guiding the pressure until the heat built the way I wanted it. He was shaking now, not with need but with restraint.

"Too much?" I asked.

"No," he said, and his voice broke on the word.

I smiled against his mouth. "Good."

There was no urgency, no fear of boots in the hall. Just the steady rise and fall of his breath, the slow pull of him inside me, the way his eyes stayed on mine as if it anchored him. I took him until the tremor eased, until his shoulders dropped, until the edge of him softened into something like peace. When he came, it was with my name, a sound pressed into my collarbone so it would not carry past the ward. I followed him with a slow, quiet shudder and held him there until the shaking passed.

I loosened the cord and rubbed the faint marks at his wrists. He flexed his hands and lifted them to my face. His fingers traced my jaw like a vow.

"Are you hurt?" he asked.

"Only tired," I said, and kissed his fingertips. "Only what the day earned."

He nodded. "I know the cost."

I rested my forehead against his. "It doesn't give you power."

"It gives me you," he said.

We cleaned each other with the water from the basin. I washed the sweat from his chest, the blood from the old cuts at his ribs. He washed me with the same care, asking each time before his hands moved. When we were done, he brought the small pot of tea he had left on the coals and poured it into two cups. We drank in silence. It was the kind of silence that does not require explanation.

He picked the book back up and read a line aloud, the cadence low and even. I listened with my head on his shoulder, eyes half-closed, letting his voice fill the space that the day had emptied.

After a time, I sat up and smoothed my skirt. The weight settled back onto my shoulders. I straightened my spine and felt the familiar line of it.

"Tomorrow," I said, "three paces in the hall."

He bowed his head. "By your consent."

"Always," I said.

He walked me to the door and stopped before the ward, hands at his sides, the distance already returned. I opened the door. The corridor waited. I looked back once and saw him at the table again, book open, candle steady, a man in a room that belonged to him.

I closed the door and left the quiet behind. The fiction would hold. The bond would too.

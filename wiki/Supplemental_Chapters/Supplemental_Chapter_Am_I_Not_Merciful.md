# Supplemental Chapter - Am I Not Merciful

### Placement
Late Act IV / early Act V, during a council session when the Necrotic King tests Astraea's nerve and Joseph is not yet in the room.

### Scene
The doors were still barred when the cold arrived.

It did not enter as frost. It entered as silence, a pressure that flattened breath and made every voice thin. Alexiana felt it first in her teeth, then in her ribs, a cold that was not temperature but intent. The torches dimmed. Shadows gathered at the seam of the ceiling as if the stone itself had opened to let something old step through. Council voices died in mid‑sentence. A map slid, unattended, across the table and stopped on its own.

The Necrotic King appeared at the far end of the throne room as if he had always been there. Bone armor, crown like a wound of black iron, a blade of dark light hanging at his side. Around him, his minions came in a tide of disciplined dead. They did not charge. They took positions with the patience of a noose, forming a quiet wall that made the room feel smaller by the breath.

"Kneel," he said.

The word was not a command. It was a weight.

The royals went down first, not by choice but by force. Alexiana felt her knees hit stone, pain lancing up her legs, the shock traveling into her hips. Breath punched out of her; she dragged it back through clenched teeth. The council buckled in a staggered line. The Grand Maester's staff rang as it struck the floor. The King Consort gritted his teeth and went down with a hiss, one hand braced for a heartbeat as if refusing the order even while obeying it. Her mother and father held their backs straight even as their knees failed them. The Paladin was a breath behind, jaw clenched, eyes blazing, forced to the same line as the rest.

Undead guards stepped in and pressed blades to throats, shoulders, the soft place below the jaw. Cold metal kissed skin. Breath fogged in the narrow space between steel and flesh. The line was perfect and humiliating. Astraea on its knees before the doctrine it had created and failed to kill. No one dared to move; even swallowing felt like a surrender.

The Necrotic King did not raise his hand to turn them. He did not reach for their breath. He knew the line of Joseph's restraint too well for that. He had learned what a Death Knight could undo, and he had learned what the living feared more than death: choice taken while the heart still beat. His head tilted, almost expectant, toward the barred doors—measuring how long Joseph would take to answer a desecration like this.

Alexiana lifted her chin, refusing to bow beyond what the pressure demanded. Her jaw locked; copper filled her mouth where she bit the inside of her cheek to keep her voice level. "You come to posture?" she asked, the queen she could be on the floor.

He looked at her as if she were a sentence he had already written. "I come to teach you what you refused to learn." His voice was quiet, but it carried. "You teach restraint as if it were mercy. You teach consent as if it were a shield. You take a knife and call it a vow."

He began to pace, slow and unhurried, between the line of kneeling rulers and the wall of his dead. The steel of his boots did not ring. It was as if even the stone had been instructed to hold its breath. When he passed close, Alexiana smelled old iron and cold ash, the memory of a battlefield after the fires went out.

"I was made to end wars," he said. "I did not fail at that. I ended them. I ended them so completely that your councils called me heresy for succeeding. I was told to be a deterrent and punished for becoming one. You wanted a blade, then recoiled when it cut clean."

The Paladin accuser's mouth tightened. The Grand Maester did not speak. Alexiana felt the pressure in her jaw, the urge to answer, but she held it. A queen listens even when she should not, and she does not give an enemy the relief of an argument.

"I watched the Order rot under your doctrine," the Necrotic King continued. "We were taught to accept cost. We were told pain was the proof of righteousness. Then you broke us for obeying. You sent paladins after what you had sanctified. You called it purity. I called it fear."

He stopped in front of the Grand Maester and tilted his head. "You trained one man to hold the line. You trained me to believe the line mattered. You told us dominion was a sin."

He looked down at his own hand as if it were evidence. "I tried to keep it. I tried to bleed for it. And every war returned because restraint lets men breathe long enough to raise another banner. My conflict ended when I chose the only thing that ends a war without asking permission. Dominion. Finality. Truth without the fiction of choice."

His gaze slid to Alexiana. "And yet you keep an army of paladins who command the living. You keep councils that decide who bleeds and who is buried. You call it law because it wears a crown. You call it mercy because you still live."

Alexiana tasted copper. She did not flinch. "Restraint is the line," she said. "You crossed it."

He let his gaze sweep the paladin and the line beside him. "Paladins of Astraea," he said, voice measured, almost courtly. "Your courage is noted. Your doctrine is not enough."

He laughed, a sound like cracking ice. "I crossed the line you drew for me. I walked into the world that refused to let me stand anywhere else." His hand drifted toward the line of kneeling rulers. "I could end you. I could take you all, erase you, and no one would ever kneel again."

He did not do it.

"I did not," he said, as if hearing Alexiana's thought. "Because mercy is a weapon too."

He turned, raising his voice so the entire chamber heard him. "I do not take you because I want you to see. I want you to live long enough to understand what I am doing."

His eyes found Alexiana again, and the pressure in the room sharpened. "I do not need you dead to win. I need you broken. I need you choosing me because you cannot bear another failure."

He spread his hands as if offering a gift. "I could have turned you. I did not. I could have snapped your oaths. I did not. I could have burned your families and called it justice. I did not." His smile thinned. "I am patient. I am precise. I am what you asked for when you begged the world to end its wars."

He walked to the center of the room, between the kneeling line and the dead, and lifted his chin. The silence was absolute.

He crossed the space in two steps and caught Alexiana’s face in his hand, thumb hard at her jaw, forcing her to meet him. His grip was cold enough to numb, the pressure biting into her cheekbone. Her stomach lurched. Her throat tried to close. She tasted iron where her teeth met the inside of her mouth and kept her eyes open anyway.

"Am I not merciful?" he shouted, the words point‑blank and merciless.

The question hit like a blow. It was not for them to answer. It was for them to carry. It was the kind of mercy that left no air.

Alexiana held her jaw steady. She felt the rage beneath her ribs, the fear in her throat, the humiliation on the stone. Her stomach rolled; she swallowed it down until it burned. She did not let any of it move her voice. A queen could not answer the Necrotic King with a sob.

The Necrotic King’s gaze slid to the council line. “Show me your obedience,” he said, as if he were granting them a lesson. His hand lifted once, and a pair of undead guards seized Minister Leto by the shoulders and dragged him forward. Leto’s eyes went wide; his mouth opened, a breath caught, and then the blade took him. His body folded to the floor with a wet thud, blood dark against the stone.

The room made a single, strangled sound. Alexiana’s father lurched as if to rise; her mother’s hand went white on the floor. Aelius swore under his breath. The Paladin’s jaw clenched so hard it shook.

“Again,” the Necrotic King said, and the line of undead turned toward the rest of them.

They raised their knives. Councilors flinched. Someone whispered a prayer. Alexiana felt the next breath stall in her chest and thought, cold and absolute: this is where we die.

The blades stopped.

The undead strained, arms shaking, heads pulled back to bare their own throats as if yanked by a force that would not allow the cut. Steel hovered a finger’s breadth from skin and would not move. The guards convulsed, dragged their own wrists down in an involuntary arc, and then turned the knives into themselves, stabbing again and again until their bodies collapsed, spent, and still.

The Necrotic King’s head tilted, eyes narrowing. He felt it—another will touching his. Another hand in his dead.

An undead Death Knight stepped from the shadow behind Alexiana, summoned into the line between the kneeling living and the King’s host. He drew his sword in one clean motion and set his stance as a shield, blade angled toward the dead, back to the living.

And then the doors blew open.

Death Magic cracked against the iron and the sound was not a roar but a clean split, stone and metal forced apart by a single will. Hinges shrieked; wards buckled. The pressure in the room wavered. The undead line faltered for a breath as a presence colder than the Necrotic King stepped across the threshold.

Joseph entered in black armor, frost on his lashes, breath a thin line in the air. He did not look at the kneeling line. He looked only at the Necrotic King. In his right hand he drew Muramasa, the shadow blade that answered his restraint. In his left he drew a second blade, bright and old, its edge pale as bone, a clean line of light against the dark.

Masamune.

Alexiana had only ever seen it wrapped, a relic under ward. She felt the room register it before she did. The Paladin's breath caught. The Grand Maester's eyes went still. The council forgot to speak.

Joseph lifted both blades, a cross of black and pale steel. The seams of his armor pulsed once, then again, a muted glow like a heart forced past its measure. His restraint frayed at the edges, visible in the tremor of his breath and the way the air thickened around him. This was not a stance for victory. It was the posture of a man about to spend himself to challenge a god.

"You came late," the Necrotic King said.

"You came for Astraea," Joseph replied. His voice was rough, but steady. He stepped forward, placing himself between the line of kneeling rulers and the King. His stance was a wall. His gaze never left the threat.

Alexiana's throat burned. She wanted to rise. She wanted to call his name. She wanted to beg him not to spend himself here, now, in front of the court. She held it. Her restraint was a knife under her tongue.

Joseph did not look back. He did not ask permission. He was beyond that now. He was the cost made flesh, and he meant to pay it.

The Necrotic King smiled, slow and curious. "Finally," he said. "A man worth killing."

The line held. The air tightened. Alexiana breathed once, steadying herself on the stone.

She had never wanted to stand so badly in her life.

The Necrotic King’s smile thinned. He let the moment hang, then stepped back into his dead. The pressure lifted in a rush, and the undead line began to withdraw as if pulled by a tide only he could command.

Joseph raised two fingers without looking away. A signal. The waiting knights poured in to secure the room. The undead Death Knight between them bowed once and dissolved into shadow, dismissed as cleanly as he had been called.

Joseph did not turn to her. He did not cross the space to check her face. He pivoted with purpose instead, scanning the hall, the doors, the windows, the corridors where the living would now be vulnerable. The sting of it landed in Alexiana’s chest, then settled into understanding. He had to hold the entire city because the living could not—something she had almost learned the hard way on that stone.

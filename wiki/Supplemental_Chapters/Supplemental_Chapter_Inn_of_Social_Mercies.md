# Supplemental Chapter - The Inn of Social Mercies

## Placement

After Chapter 10. Joseph has returned to Astraea and recovered enough to stand. Public fiction still holds; intimacy remains private.

## Scene

Astraea wanted the Death Knight alive, but not near its heart. I learned that the city could hold two truths in the same breath: relief that he had returned, and unease that he walked their streets.

I did not send him back to the Reliquary. Not yet. He was well enough to sleep somewhere that was not a tomb, and I was tired of letting the Council decide where he could exist.

I did not trust the Grand Maester. I had no proof, only mannerisms: the way he held his answers in counsel, the way his pauses felt rehearsed, the way he called restraint “doctrine” when it served the Council. He had never lied outright, but he had not told the whole truth, either. Love makes you attentive to what is missing.

So I took Aelius, two guards, and Joseph into the city and knocked on doors.

The first innkeeper bowed too low and said there were no rooms. I saw lit windows and fresh linen through the open door.

"We are full," the innkeeper said, eyes fixed on the floor.

"You have six rooms open," I said. I did not raise my voice; I did not need to.

The innkeeper swallowed. "Those are reserved."

"For whom?"

"Traveling clergy," he said, lying without looking up.

Joseph did not speak. He held the silence like a blade he refused to draw. The guard on my right shifted, waiting for an order to turn this into something public.

I chose not to.

"Thank you for your time," I said, and left without making it a test. The innkeeper did not thank Joseph. He did not even look at him.

At the next inn, a matronly woman told us the attic had collapsed. I saw a boy run down the stairs with a fresh armful of towels.

"We have no space," the woman said. Her fingers twisted her apron until her knuckles went white.

Aelius smiled as if to soften it. It worked on the woman, not on the crowd. People had gathered, drawn by the King Consort the way they were drawn by hope. Hands reached for him, blessings and cheers pressed close. He was beloved in a way I had never been allowed to be.

"Go," I said quietly to Aelius. "They need you more than they need me right now."

He hesitated, then let himself be pulled away by the crowd. A wave of sound followed him down the street. I felt it fade the longer I stood beside Joseph.

We walked to the next inn in a quieter lane. The sign above the door read: INN OF SOCIAL MERCIES.

Joseph stopped outside, eyes on the door. "This one," he said. It was not a claim. It was a choice.

Inside, the innkeeper was older, with a soft tremor in his hands that did not quite become fear. He looked at me and saw me, truly saw me, and bowed the way one does to a queen who has not asked for ceremony.

"Majesty."

"We need a room," I said. "For him."

The innkeeper glanced at Joseph and nodded once. "I have an attic room."

My mouth tightened. "An attic."

"It is quiet," he said. "The farthest place. It is the place we offer him."

"Offer," I repeated. "You mean you put him away."

The innkeeper met my gaze. "We put him where the noise cannot reach. We do not mean insult. We mean...breathing room. For everyone."

Joseph's mouth twitched. A smirk, brief and private, passed between him and the innkeeper like a shared language. Joseph nodded once.

I saw it and felt the edge of anger sharpen into understanding. The city was not hostile. It was uneasy. It was taught to be uneasy.

"This is custom," the innkeeper said. "The Paladins preach caution. The Council speaks of risk. We learned to keep him away from the rooms where children sleep. Not because we fear him. Because we fear what we are told to fear."

I breathed in, slow. "Do you thank him?"

The innkeeper shook his head. "Not to his face. We leave what we can after he goes. Bread. Repairs. Notes. We do not make a spectacle of our gratitude."

He gestured toward the stairs. "It is small."

"Show me," I said.

We climbed to the top. The attic room was exactly what the innkeeper promised: a low ceiling, a narrow bed, a wash basin, a small table with a single chair, a window that looked over roofs instead of streets. The air smelled of old wood and soap. No tapestries. No banners. No throne.

Joseph set his pack down. He looked at the room once and nodded.

"It is enough," he said.

I stood in the doorway, studying the slanted roof and the single candle. My queen's instinct wanted a suite. My woman's instinct wanted privacy and a door that could be barred. I held both and chose the one that kept him safe.

"We will pay twice," I told the innkeeper.

"We will not take twice," he replied, and backed away before the guards could find offense in it.

As we descended, I saw a loaf of bread and a small bunch of dried herbs set on the stair landing. No note. No name. The innkeeper did not see it; the innkeeper did not need to. Someone in the kitchen had left it there after Joseph passed. He did not look at it. He did not need to.

Outside, I found Aelius again, breathless and smiling from the crowd. He bowed to me, still playing the part even when he was tired.

"They love you," I said.

"They love a symbol," he replied. "You love a man." He looked at Joseph once, no bitterness in his face this time, only a newly tempered respect. "They are both necessary."

I nodded. I understood the shape of the city a little better now. The Paladins and the Council had taught them fear. I would teach them restraint. In time.

That night, I returned in a cloak with the hood drawn low, my crown left on its hook. A guard at the alley's mouth saw me and looked away. Consent extended to secrecy. I knocked twice.

Joseph opened the door. He did not touch me. He waited.

"May I?" I asked.

"Yes," he said.

The room smelled of soap and ink. He had not lit the candle. He had been waiting in the dark. When I stepped inside, he barred the door without a sound and leaned back against it, a man who had learned to exist in spaces that were never fully his.

I took off my cloak. He watched me as if every movement might undo him. The first thing my eyes found were his hands. The pale seams on his knuckles were not wounds. They were the shape of what had been spent. Old, weighty, and quiet.

I reached for them. He flinched, then held still. Consent in the smallest movement.

"These do not hurt?" I asked.

"Not anymore," he said. "They are weight, not pain."

I slid my fingers along his wrists, then under his shirt. The scars there were ridged like old rope. Across his ribs, pale seams marked where barriers had been held too long. I exhaled, slow, feeling a new anger rise that had no place to go.

"You carry all of it," I said.

"I carry what I choose," he replied. "And what I was made to."

I pressed my forehead to his chest. "I did not understand."

"You did not have to."

I leaned back, cupped his jaw. "But I do now."

He did not turn away. His breath broke on the last word.

"If a scar forms here," he said, and guided my hand to the back of his neck, just below the skull, "the echoes stop. They will not answer again. Barriers and strikes will still come, but the larger call dies. That loss does not reverse."

I held my hand there, feeling the warmth of his skin and the starkness of his truth. I did not ask him if he feared it. The answer was in his stillness.

"Then I will be the only one who knows it," I said.

He nodded once. "That is mercy."

I kissed him. Slow at first. He did not move until I moved. "May I?" he asked against my mouth.

"Yes," I said. "But you wait until I tell you."

"Always."

I guided him back to the bed. The room was narrow; there was nowhere to hide, nowhere to perform. I unfastened his belt and looped it around his wrists, loose enough for a finger beneath, enough to remind him of choice. He watched my hands, the way he watched a blade.

"Too tight?" I asked.

"No," he said. "Keep it."

"Mouth," I said.

He looked up. "May I?"

"Yes." He obeyed, reverent and slow, his breath warming my skin, his mouth asking with every pause. I set the pace. I kept my hand on the knot of his belt to feel the tension and the trust in it.

I lowered onto him with care, inch by inch, until he filled me and my breath broke. I set the rhythm, deliberate, a choice in every roll of my hips. He trembled, the tremor of restraint and exhaustion, and I steadied him with my palm on his chest.

"Stay," I said.

He did.

I moved faster, then slower, guiding him through the edge of it, not letting him lose himself. When he asked, I said yes. When I said stop, he stopped. Consent looped between us like a tether.

He came with his eyes open, watching me as if I were the only light in the room. I followed him, mouth on his, tasting salt and smoke and the quiet ash of the city outside. I held him until the shaking passed.

After, I loosened the belt and kissed the marks left on his wrists. I smoothed his hair back from his temple and pressed my forehead to his.

"Cost paid," I whispered.

"Chosen," he said.

I dressed without urgency. I was not ready to leave, but I would not make this room a spectacle. I kissed him once more, then stepped back.

"In the morning," I said, "they will see a Death Knight in an attic room and think it is mercy."

"It is," he replied, voice low. "For them. And for me."

I pulled up my hood and opened the door.

"May I return?" I asked.

"Where you ask," he said.

I slipped out into the night. The city slept uneasy, and the Inn of Social Mercies held its quiet, not as exile, but as the only space a man like him was allowed to be both feared and safe.

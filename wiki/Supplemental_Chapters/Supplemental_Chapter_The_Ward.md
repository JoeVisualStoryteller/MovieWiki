# Supplemental Chapter - The Ward

## Placement

After the successful siege defense and Joseph's collapse, during the council session when Astraea debates calling East-North and East-South for aid.

## Scene

Alexiana held the council together by force of habit. The room still smelled of smoke and old blood, as if the siege had seeped into the stone and refused to leave.

The throne room was full of voices. Envoys spoke over maps. The High Priestess lifted her hands, palms open. "If we ask East-North for aid, they will ask for our shrines in return. We cannot trade sanctity for survival." Minister Leto tapped the map with a finger. "Then we give them tariffs and ports, not altars. We can name the terms and make them believe they chose them. He has already broken their eastern cities. They know his power, and they're rebuilding -- which makes the alliance harder, not easier, but no less necessary." The general leaned over the table. "I can hold the western line for a week. After that I need bodies, not prayers." The old councillors argued for patience, for strength, for not showing weakness. The younger ones argued for speed, for reaching East-North and East-South before the Necrotic King decided their borders were next. Her father wanted a formal appeal. Her mother wanted a quiet alliance. Aelius wanted a promise the aid would not come with a price Astraea could not afford.

Joseph's chair was empty. His space in the room felt loud. She kept her gaze off the door; if she looked at it too long, she would stand.

"Without him, the western line fails," the general said. "We do not have another week."

Minister Leto's finger cut across the map. "Then we name that truth. We make the deterrent part of the terms and we do not apologize for it."

The High Priestess looked at him as if he had suggested a sacrifice. "He is not an altar."

The Paladin folded his arms. "He is a risk. One man is not a strategy."

"He is a man," Alexiana said. "And he saved this city. We do not spend him because we are afraid."

Aelius's voice was quiet, but it carried. "He bled for us. We do not pay him by bleeding him dry."

"We cannot send our banners to kneel," one councillor said. "They will demand it."

"They will demand it if we bleed in silence," another replied. "We can set the terms."

Alexiana lifted her hand once, and the room quieted. "We will not beg," she said. "We will negotiate. We will name the cost of our deterrent and remind them the cost of their refusal."

"You say deterrent," the Paladin said. "The city says miracle. The court says risk."

Her jaw tightened. "The city says he saved them. The court can learn to live with the truth."

The air went cold before she finished the sentence.

It was not the slow chill of winter. It dropped like a blade. Breath went thin. The torches along the wall guttered in unison. A pressure settled in the room, heavy enough to bend knees.

The Necrotic King appeared as if he had stepped out of the shadow between two banners. His crown was a wound of black iron. His eyes were not eyes. They were absence.

He lifted his hand.

Pain hit all at once, a spike driven into bone. Alexiana's vision tunneled. The world shrank to breath and marrow. Her ribs felt as if they were being pried open from the inside. Breath turned thin and sharp; each inhale scraped, each exhale burned. Her teeth clicked. The pull in her marrow turned into a drag, and something cold began to climb her spine as if it wanted to rewrite her from within.

The councillor at her right cried out and went to his knees, retching until strings of bile hung from his mouth. Someone behind her vomited hard enough to fold over the table. The High Priestess tried to speak a prayer, "Mercy--" and the word shattered into a choke. Minister Leto swore, then gasped as his knees buckled. The general reached for his sword; his hand locked, and the blade clattered against the chair leg. The room was forced to its knees, all of them, bodies dragged down by a will that did not care for rank or oath -- her parents, the Paladin, the councillors, even Alexiana. A guard's knees skidded on the stone; he caught himself on the pillar, nails leaving dark crescents in stone. Her mother went down hard, breath hissing. Her father hit a knee and stayed there, jaw clenched. Aelius made a sound she had never heard him make, low and raw, as if the pain had found something it had always wanted -- and then his breath stopped. His eyes filmed, his lips went black, his skin took the ash-gray of death. For a heartbeat he was not her consort, but a husk in the Queen's hall.

The Necrotic King spoke, and the sound went through her rather than to her. "Yield." His gaze slid to Aelius. "If they do not turn fast enough, you will kill them."

Something in Aelius's face went hollow. He lurched to his feet as if yanked by a chain and took a step toward the dais, eyes fixed on Alexiana. His hand went for his blade.

Her fingers clawed the arm of the throne. Her spine held, but her throat tried to close. The ache in her wrists turned to a twist, tendons screaming as if they were being pulled tight and wrong. She could see it happening to the others -- skin going gray, lips darkening, veins webbing black. A young scribe stared at her hands as the nails blued, cracked, and bled. The Paladin's oath-light flared, then sputtered as if a wet hand had closed over it.

He warded the doors with a gesture. The iron boomed as the wards sealed. The room was locked with them inside, a tomb with breath still in it.

The bone-ache worsened. Alexiana felt the start of it in her wrists, the slight pull as if her own fingers were trying to bend away from her will. It crawled into her elbows, her jaw, the hinge of her knees, each joint lighting up as if pried open by cold hands. A tremor ran through her legs. She tasted iron and knew it was not her own blood. Her fingers wanted to curl into claws and she forced them flat.
This is what it feels like, she thought. Not a spell, not a wound, but her own body being rewritten while she was still inside it. The pain was everywhere at once, a net of hooks in bone and breath, dragging her toward something she did not consent to become. She could not scream; she could only endure.
This is it. I'm sorry, Joseph. Please be quick if you strike me down. Don't hesitate.

Then the first knuckle in her hand went white -- and the doors exploded outward.

Stone fragments skittered across the floor. The ward on the door tore like cloth. A line of cold cut through the room, clean and deliberate, and the pull on her bones broke.

Joseph stood in the threshold.

He should not have been standing. He should have been in bed. He should have been unconscious. The bandages were still on his ribs. A dark line ran from his nose to his mouth. His face was the wrong color, his eyes too dim. He leaned forward, one hand braced on the frame as if it were the only reason he stayed upright.

He lifted his other hand. The air around the living snapped with a different cold. Barriers shimmered into place -- thin, precise, each one an envelope around a body. Alexiana felt the pressure on her bones ease. The scribe gasped. The Paladin coughed as the oath-light steadied, the light shivering like a flame in wind.
Aelius jerked as if yanked back from a cliff. Color flooded his face. He sucked in a ragged breath and pushed to his feet, alive again. The room went still in collective disbelief. Even the Paladin stared.
She breathed his name. "Joseph." The word was a warning. You should be resting. I'm not worth this.

Joseph did not look at any of them. His eyes were on the Necrotic King.

"No," Joseph said. His voice was low, hoarse. "Not the living. This has gone on long enough."
He swayed as he said it, one shoulder hitting the frame, the words held up by will more than strength.

The Necrotic King smiled. It was a slow baring of nothing. His blade appeared in his hand as if it had always been there, a length of black with a lightless edge.

Joseph answered without a word. Muramasa came to him the way breath returned after drowning, and the room went colder. He moved anyway -- not fast, but inevitable. He crossed the distance and met the first strike.

The clang rang off the ceiling. Joseph's arm shook with it. He took the second strike on his shoulder and did not flinch. Blood ran from under the bandage. His knees buckled once, then locked. He swallowed and the tremor returned. The blade dipped; he forced it back up.

They traded blows in the space between the throne and the council table. The Necrotic King moved like a shadow. Joseph moved like a man too tired to die. He did not call the dead. He did not take what he could. He held the line. Each strike rang through the barriers; each ring made them flare, the room’s cold stuttering against the warded living. One barrier blinked; a clerk whimpered; Joseph’s jaw tightened and the line held.

The Necrotic King drove him back with a wide cut. Joseph caught it, twisted, and stepped in. He took a hit to the ribs that would have broken any living man, then a second that drove him into the edge of the council table. Wood cracked. He pushed off it anyway. His mouth opened, closed. He did not cry out. He kept his footing. The restraint was in every breath -- measured, exact, refusing to become dominion even now.

Alexiana stood, fists clenched. She did not move, but her restraint cracked at the edges. "Joseph, no," she said, the words torn low and urgent. "Do not." Her face stayed composed for the room while her throat burned.

The Necrotic King raised his hand, the compulsion flaring again. Alexiana felt the pull in her bones return, a thin blade sliding back under her skin as the barriers strained. Joseph lifted his own and re-knit the line, a blade of cold air that split the pressure in the room. He staggered. His hand trembled. He set it anyway.

The Grand Maester appeared at the edge of the dais as if he had been there all along. His staff tapped once. The air went very still.

He struck.

Death Magic speared across the room, not a wave but a precise line. It hit the Necrotic King in the chest and cracked his armor with a sound like splitting stone. The Necrotic King stumbled, his blade dipping.

Joseph took the opening. He drove Muramasa forward in a tight arc and forced the Necrotic King back. The shadow recoiled, its edges fraying.

The Necrotic King did not fall. He did not die. He retreated in a rush of black that took the cold with it, leaving the air to warm by degrees.

Silence dropped into the throne room. Only breathing remained. No one moved, as if the shadow might step back through the wall if they did.

Joseph swayed. The barrier around Alexiana flickered. He reached to steady it and failed. The edge of it dissolved, and the room felt suddenly too bright. The cold had not fully left; she could still feel its echo in her bones.

Alexiana stepped down one stair. She did not reach for him. She could not. The council was watching. The Paladin's eyes were still on her. Her parents were pale. Aelius had a hand to his chest, steadying his own breath.

Joseph looked at her.

He was grey with it. His lips were cracked. He should have been in a bed. He should have been unconscious.

She kept her chin lifted. She held his gaze. Her mouth formed two words without sound.

Thank you.

He blinked once. The smallest nod. Then his knees gave out and he went down hard on one hand, Muramasa fading like a memory. He did not fall all the way. He caught himself, then the strength left him and he did.

Alexiana turned to the room. "Secure the doors," she said. "Double the wards. No one enters without my leave."

Her voice did not shake. Her eyes did.

When the guards moved, when the council finally remembered to breathe, she went to him. She knelt at his side and placed her hand on his wrist as if checking a pulse, as if she were simply doing her duty. Nothing, then a faint beat, slow and stubborn.

Aelius stepped in without waiting for permission. He lifted Joseph with care, one arm under his shoulders, one under his knees, and turned toward the Reliquary. "I'll carry him," he said, the words spare and certain.

She let her shoulders shake once. Then she steadied them, stood, and became the Queen again.

"We will speak of alliances after the healer speaks of him," she said. "This is the cost. Let the record show it."

No one argued. Aelius met Alexiana's gaze once, then looked at Joseph with something new in his eyes -- not courtesy, but respect.

# Supplemental Chapter - Am I Not Merciful: Aftermath

### Placement
Directly after the throne room confrontation in “Am I Not Merciful,” once the Necrotic King withdraws.

### Scene
“Secure the hall,” Joseph said, voice pitched for command, not comfort. “Check the wards. Sweep the rafters. Leave no shadow unsearched.”

Knights poured past him, boots slamming stone, helms turning upward, blades out. A pair moved to Leto’s body and hesitated. Alexiana lifted her chin. “Remove him,” she ordered, and the men obeyed, lifting the minister with the care of a broken relic.

“Council,” Alexiana said, and the word snapped the room into a second order. “Now. Emergency protocol. We do not leave this hall. We do not speculate in corridors.”

The captain sealed the doors. The remaining councilors formed a tight half-circle at the base of the dais. The Paladin accuser stepped in with them, jaw set. The Grand Maester stayed just behind Alexiana’s shoulder, staff planted, eyes on the broken doorway.

“We have three decisions,” Alexiana said. “Contain the breach. Control the narrative. Hold the wall.”

A councilor spoke first, voice shaking. “If he can enter like this, the wards are useless.”

“Then we harden the inner ring,” the Grand Maester replied, cold. “We shift ward anchors to the Reliquary and the throne vault. We stop the seams before they open.”

The Paladin accuser’s gaze stayed on the broken doors. “Doctrine failed today,” he said. “That is not a sentence we can afford to say aloud.”

“We won’t,” Alexiana said. “We will call it a security breach. We will name the dead. We will not say kneeling.”

Her mother inhaled sharply. “And the people?”

“We give them a story that holds,” Alexiana said. “The King will speak. The Queen will stand. The Death Knight will be at the wall.”

Her father nodded once. “Then we move before panic does.”

Her legs burned as she stood. The room tilted for a heartbeat, then steadied under her will. The Grand Maester rose beside her, staff still. The Paladin accuser got to his feet last, a fraction too slow, his eyes fixed on the place where the Necrotic King had stood.

“You will seal the doors,” Alexiana said to the captain. “No one leaves until I say. No rumor runs faster than my orders.” She turned to the councilors who could still meet her gaze. “We speak of this as a breach, not a kneeling. We grieve Minister Leto and we move. Do you understand?”

They nodded, shaken, obedient. Fear in their faces, yes—but also a new, raw clarity. They had seen mercy used as a weapon. They had seen what the living could not undo.

Joseph had not moved from his line. Muramasa and Masamune were gone now, returned to shadow and sheath, but the cold around him remained. He looked past her, past the council, as if the rest of the city were already on fire.

“Majesty,” he said, formal and spare. “He will come again. Not here. Somewhere softer.” He let the words hang, a warning without spectacle. “I will take the wall.”

He turned his head to the council line, voice still measured. “You may crucify me for this later. I cannot be in two places at once. Forgive me, my Queen, my King, and the Council.”

The cold thickened. A figure stepped out of shadow as if the air had learned a new shape. One of the original twelve, drawn from the earliest echoes of the Order. The Grand Maester went rigid, recognition flickering across his face.

“Guard the Queen until I return,” Joseph said.

The Death Knight’s helm lifted. His voice came clear, not a grunt or a hollow echo, but a living cadence reborn. “Virtus et Honor,” he said, and set his blade at Alexiana’s side as if the oath itself had taken form.

Alexiana’s breath caught. The sound of him speaking—of any of them speaking—made the hair along her arms rise. It was not just protection; it was a memory of what the Order had once been. For a heartbeat she felt the weight of it settle between her and the court.

Alexiana wanted to say his name. She wanted to tell him to breathe, to look at her, to remember that he was still a man. The words caught on the crown in her throat. “Do it,” she said instead. “And return.”

He inclined his head once, not a bow, not a promise, but acknowledgment. Then he was moving, armor quiet despite its weight, out through the broken doors, into the cold he carried like a rule.

When he was gone, she let her breath out in one slow line. The stain of Leto’s blood darkened the stone. The council stood behind her, waiting for a decree. The Paladin accuser watched her, and for the first time his doctrine did not sound like a shield.

“Get him to the Reliquary,” she said of Leto, voice steady. “We keep his name. We do not erase what happened here.”

She did not say Joseph’s name aloud. She did not need to. It beat in her mouth like a wound, and she carried it with her as she stepped into the next order.

Shouts rose from the outer corridor. Knights at the threshold stiffened, turning toward the sound. A scout burst into the hall, breath ragged. “He placed the archers along the north parapet,” the scout blurted. “Left a lesser echo to hold the gate. Then he went into the city. He said the square had to be secured.”

The scout swallowed and forced the rest out. “There’s an undead Paladin in the square. It charged him. He ordered the townspeople down—told them to take cover. He’s fighting it there, in the open.”

The Death Knight at Alexiana’s side met her eyes. The contact was not spoken, but it was clear—an old discipline of the Order, a mind‑to‑mind cadence she felt more than heard. *Your husband is fine. Paladins couldn’t kill us then, and they can’t kill us now. Ask the Grand Maester. He’s killed plenty in his time.*

The sounds from the square turned to a brief, terrible clash—holy light against Death Magic. The air seemed to grind; the noise was inhumane, unforgiving, the kind of sound that made teeth ache. Then it stopped.

Joseph stepped back into the throne room, armor spattered, breath thin but controlled. “I neutralized the threat,” he said, voice even. He turned his head to the Paladin accuser. “One of yours needs an honored sendoff. He upheld his doctrine even in death.”

He inclined his head to the Death Knight beside Alexiana. “Thank you.” The echo bowed once and dissolved into shadow at his leave.

Joseph moved to his place, three paces behind her, the distance reasserted as if it were a law.

Alexiana let the silence settle, then lifted her chin. “We honor the dead,” she said, voice carrying to the council and the paladin alike. “We bury courage with the name it earned. And we do not forget the living who held this room when doctrine failed.” She did not look back at Joseph. She did not need to.

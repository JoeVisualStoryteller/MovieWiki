# Supplemental Chapter - The Coronation (Alexiana POV)

Alexiana's coronation was a weight she did not set down. The crown was cold as it touched her brow, a circle that closed and would not open. Oaths rose around her like a tide; hymns shook the beams. The roar of Astraea's approval hit her like heat, then fell away, as if she watched from behind glass.

Incense and wax thickened the air. Crushed flowers bled their sweetness into the stone. The banner cloths swayed and the whole hall swayed with them, a slow breathing she had to match. Her spine stayed straight. Her jaw set. The inside of her cheek tasted of copper where she had bitten it to keep her voice steady.

She lifted her eyes to the crowd and saw black where it did not belong.

For a heartbeat, she thought it was a trick of light. Then she saw the matte armor and the man she had not seen for years. Joseph stood among the people without banner or herald, as if he had stepped out of rumor and into a day that had no right to hold him.

Her throat tightened. Heat and cold traded places in her chest. The crown pressed down; her heart pulled forward. It took every breath to keep her face still. If she moved, the court would see. If she did not, she might never see him again.

She moved too soon. The ceremony barely ended before she was off the dais, slipping between guards, past councilors, past the weight of her own title.

"Majesty--" a guard started.

"Not now," she said, and went.

She chased the last black shadow she had seen through columns and courtyards, past fountains she had once played beside. The day smelled of wax, sweat, and crushed flowers under hurried boots. She called his name under her breath and did not wait for permission to want him. She turned a corner too late.

He was gone.

No footsteps. No trace. The city swallowed him as if it had never offered him. She stood with her palm against the stone, the pulse in her wrist matching the last hymn still echoing in the hall. The crown's weight did not ease. It only became a second heartbeat.

That night, when the palace finally quieted, she stood in her chamber with the crown set aside. The day's noise had left her hollow. The door opened without announcement. King Consort Aelius entered with a plain cloth bundle in his hand.

"What is this?" he asked, unwrapping it as a question he already resented.

Joseph's helmet lay in the cloth, black and unadorned, as if it had been left on purpose and forgotten by everyone else.

Aelius turned it once, weighing its value. "A broken toy," he said, and started to set it aside.

Alexiana crossed the room in two steps. "Do not," she said, voice low.

He paused, surprised at the steel.

"It is not a toy," she said. "It is a vow."

He frowned. "He is not yours to keep."

"He has never been yours to discard," she answered. The words landed harder than she intended. The day had scraped her raw.

Silence stretched between them. She took the helmet from his hands and set it gently on the table, as if it were still alive.

"Give me space," she said. "I will speak to you when I am ready."

He hesitated, then left.

Alone, she traced the rim of the helmet with her fingertips. The metal was cold. So was the loss. She had let the court take him once. She had let silence do the rest. She could still feel the moment she had not spoken, the fight she had not waged.

"I saw you," she said to the empty room, voice low. "I should have said it when I could."

She pressed the helmet to her chest as if it could answer her. It did not. It only reminded her: the day she became Queen was the day she did not choose him.

She lay down without undressing, the crown on the table, the helmet at her side. Her body ached with a want she could not name aloud. The Queen went to bed with the weight of the crown, the ache of the man she still loved, and the regret of the chance she had let slip past her like a shadow in a crowd.

# Supplemental Chapter - Recall: Ruins (Alternate Chapter 8)

### Placement
Alternate Chapter 8. Joseph is recalled and returns to a capital already razed by the Necrotic King.

### Scene
Joseph reached the western ridge before dusk and saw the city from the high road. Astraea was smoke and hollow light. The outer walls were torn open where the gates had been. The towers were black down to their bones. The river ran red in the low places. He did not slow. He did not allow himself to name what he saw. He had been recalled. The city was gone. Alexiana was not at the gate.

The road down was littered with bodies. Some were living enough to whisper, some were not. He passed a cart burned in place, a horse split under it, a child's shoe turned on its side in the ash. The air reeked of smoke and wet iron. He stepped over an arm that still wore a palace braid, over a guard whose chest had been caved in by something too heavy to lift. He saw the signs of turning: skin grayed to paper, eyes fogged, fingers curled into hooks. He saw the signs of refusal: throats cut, wrists opened, a desperate denial of what was coming. The Necrotic King had left nothing whole.

He pushed through the breach and into the inner streets. Houses stood with their fronts torn away as if the city itself had been peeled open. Bodies lay in doorways, in wells, in the square, piled where the living had tried to gather. A woman knelt at a child who no longer moved. A man pressed his face to a wall and moaned without sound. Joseph wanted to stop. He did not.

"Alexiana," he called once, and the city did not answer.

He cut toward the palace on memory alone. The eastern courtyard was cratered. Marble steps had been shattered and ground into white powder. Statues lay on their faces. The fountain had become a bowl of black water. He tasted blood and smoke and kept moving.

He reached the Reliquary and found the doors sealed from within. Wards hummed in the stone, a layered weave that belonged to the Grand Maester. Joseph set his palm to it and felt the tension pull back against his hand. He was already exhausted, already hollow from the ride, but he pressed anyway. Cold slid under his skin. The ward yielded, thread by thread, until the door sighed open.

He stepped inside and the air changed. The ruin fell away. The Reliquary was intact, its walls lit by thin blue flame. In the center of the hall Alexiana stood with the Grand Maester, the Paladin, and the High Priestess. Blood streaked the floor where the ward had pulled the wounded inside. The Paladin's armor was cracked. The High Priestess held her side, a cloth dark with blood. The Grand Maester's staff was planted like a spine.

For a heartbeat, Joseph could not breathe.

Alexiana turned toward the door. Her face was pale, her hair damp with sweat, her jaw locked to keep it from shaking. When she saw him, something in her eyes broke and mended in the same instant.

"Joseph," she said, and it was not a command. It was a sound she had been holding for hours.

He took one step and sank to a knee, not in submission but from the weight of what he had seen. He forced himself up again. "You are here," he said. The words were simple because anything else would have torn him open.

Alexiana moved toward him and stopped short, the old rule still inside her. The Paladin looked between them, breath ragged. The High Priestess lowered her gaze. The Grand Maester did not move.

"He breached the wall," Alexiana said. "He came through the halls. We sealed ourselves before the last gate fell." Her voice tightened. "We held. But only because you were not here to take the burden."

Joseph looked at the ward lines on the floor. "You did what you had to."

Alexiana swallowed. The city was gone. The ward held. Her world had shrunk to the man in black armor who had returned too late and still returned. She felt the urge to touch him, to prove he was real, and forced her hand to stay at her side.

"He will come back," the Grand Maester said. "He wanted the city to see. He wanted us to kneel."

Joseph's eyes went to the broken paladin. "Did he take the living?"

"He tried," the Paladin said, jaw tight with humiliation. "He failed inside the ward."

"Then he will try again outside it," Joseph said.

Alexiana felt the shift in the room. The Reliquary had kept them alive. It could not keep the city. She had lost the capital, the court, and the people to ash, and still she had to decide what came next.

"We will hold the inner ring," she said, and her voice turned back into a crown. "We will count the living. We will bury the dead. And we will not turn into what he is." Her eyes met Joseph's. "Do you understand?"

He nodded once. "Restraint is the line."

Outside, the city burned. Inside, Alexiana stood and did not allow herself to fall.

The ward hummed behind Joseph, a thin boundary between the ruin and the living, and he turned toward it as if it were a promise he intended to keep.

He lifted his hand and the cold deepened. Shapes rose from the floor, a line of Death Knight generals taking form in the blue light, helms bowed in the old way. One stepped forward. "Your command?"

Joseph's voice went flat with command. "We need to retake what's left of this city. Normally we would hit it with Death Magic and move on, but this. This is my home. Search and clear. Get any living to safety. Destroy the undead."

"As commanded," the first said. The others echoed him, a chorus of consent and iron. "Search and clear." "To safety." "Destroy."

The living in the Reliquary stood stunned, the Paladin's mouth open, the High Priestess rigid, the Grand Maester watching without blinking. Alexiana felt her heart break for him and with him. He had returned to ash and still chose restraint. He had called it home, and that word landed in her chest like a blade she would carry for him.

Joseph turned to the Grand Maester. "How long will the ward hold?"

"Long enough," the old man said, as if it were a casual matter of candle hours instead of lives.

Joseph nodded once. "Then hold the line."

Beyond the stone, the city answered him with the sound of fighting. He lifted his eyes to Alexiana, the command in him bending to her authority. "What will you have me do, my Queen?"

She did not look at the blood on the floor or the broken armor. She looked at the map of a city in her mind, at the routes to the river, the choke points, the districts still standing. "Retake the inner ring first," she said. "Keep the palace quarter and the river road. Evacuate the living to the Reliquary and the south gate. We will hold the center so the east can flee."

Joseph nodded once. Masamune slid into his hand, pale steel answering the cold in his bones. He said nothing more. He turned and went, armor quiet, the order in his spine carrying him through the ward and back into the ruin.

Minutes later the first survivors arrived, driven by the thunder of boots and the clatter of bone. Undead and echoes escorted them in, hands steady, blades down. The living recoiled anyway. A woman clutched a boy to her chest and backed against the wall. A man lifted a broken chair as if it could stop the dead. Their fear was raw and earned. They had seen the dead raze the city and could not yet believe the same shapes were now saving them.

"Open the ward," Alexiana said. "They need shelter."

The Grand Maester's jaw tightened. "If we lower it, he will find us."

"If we keep it, they die outside it," she said. The words were not a plea. They were a command dressed as mercy.

He held her gaze for a long breath, then gave a single nod. The ward slackened. The cold line thinned. The doors opened, and the living stumbled into the Reliquary, coughing, bleeding, eyes wide with disbelief. Alexiana moved among them without touching, her voice low and steady, a Queen turned to triage.

A healer pressed a rag into her palm. She took it and knelt anyway. The High Priestess bound a man's shoulder with practiced hands, murmuring a prayer that was more directive than comfort. The Paladin lifted a woman who could not walk and carried her to the light. The Grand Maester set a palm to a child's forehead and spoke a ward that quieted the shaking. They worked without argument, four pillars bracing a room that had begun to sway.

Questions came in a flood. "Are we safe?" "Is the King dead?" "Was it our dead that did this?" "Why are they helping us now?" Alexiana answered what she could and did not lie about what she could not. "You are under the Queen's ward," she said. "The city is broken, not lost." The Grand Maester kept his voice flat and precise. The High Priestess told them where to sit, where to breathe, where to wait. The Paladin stood between the worst fear and the weakest bodies. The work was not mercy. It was survival, given a human face.

A Death Knight general stepped forward, helm turned toward her. "Sir Joseph is engaged in the inner ring. He needs our assistance."

The remaining echoes in the hall re-formed at once, a silent line rising from shadow. They bowed to Alexiana, then turned as one and marched back through the doors to join him.

An hour later Joseph came back through the ward with his breath ragged and blood dried to black along his collar. The years had begun to show in him, a weight that no armor could hide. He did not sit. "We hold the inner ring," he said. "The Necrotic King has not revealed himself."

His knee buckled. He caught the wall with a gauntlet and stayed upright by force of will alone.

Alexiana was at his side before the echo cleared the door. She slipped a cloth under his gauntlet and pressed it to the cut at his collar, her hands steady, her breath controlled. She would not let the room see her break. She would not let him see it either.

A civilian pushed forward, eyes wild. "Sir Joseph! You're alive! We thought you died."

Alexiana felt the words land like grit under her skin. Who had spread that rumor, and why? She tucked the question away and kept her focus on Joseph, tightening the cloth, checking his ribs by touch, refusing to let grief outrun duty.

Before she could finish, Joseph stood. The motion pulled blood into his throat. He turned his head and coughed once, catching it in his gauntlet, the red hidden by metal. He did not let the room take the sound from him.

Another echo appeared at the threshold. "Sir, the Necrotic King is on the ridgeline."

Joseph did not hesitate. "My horse," he said. "This ends tonight."

The echo bowed. "Your cavalry awaits," he said. "Scouts report archers and artillery."

The Paladin's voice snapped across the hall. "You're not going to do what I think you're going to do."

Alexiana's head lifted. "Do what?" she asked, even as she already knew.

Joseph did not answer. He was already moving, armor quiet, the decision sealed behind his eyes.

The echo watched him go. "He's going to ride into them," he said, and it was not a warning so much as a fact.

Alexiana kept her spine straight. She kept her hands steady. It was a living technique, the old discipline of officers and queens: if you do not break, the room does not break. She had watched the living try a frontal stand on the wall earlier, riding straight into archers and artillery with steel and prayer, and it had failed miserably. The memory of that failure sat in her ribs as she held the room together with the last of her restraint and let her grief stay locked behind her teeth.

Silence held. The living waited. Then, from beyond the ward and the stone, a shout rose, not a scream, but a battle cry of victory.

The echoes were dismissed. The cold in the hall eased as the undead formations unraveled into shadow. Joseph returned to the Reliquary with soot on his armor and a thin line of blood at his throat. He stopped in front of Alexiana and said, quiet and certain, "You have your city back, my Queen." Then he turned and walked out of the hall as if he had already given everything he was allowed to give.

The living followed him into the light. The city was scarred and smoking, but it stood. Fires were out in some streets. A few banners had been raised where walls still held. Survivors moved in small, cautious lines. It was not a victory, but it was a chance to rebuild.

Alexiana found Joseph at the stable, tightening a cinch, the horse already saddled. The old reflex took him: leave before he could be asked, remove the risk, spare the city the sight of him lingering. He had not been given an order, and he did not assume one.

She stepped closer. "You think you should go," she said.

He did not deny it. "It is better for the city," he said. "A Death Knight inside the walls draws fear before it draws safety. The Grand Maester told me you prefer it that way."

Alexiana blinked, the confusion sharp and immediate. Prefer it? She had never said that, never asked for it, and the words sat wrong in her chest.

She lifted her chin. "Be my Honor Guard again." The composure in his face slipped, just for a heartbeat, as if the order reached the part of him that had been holding itself upright.

He looked past her, toward the ruined streets. "The Council--"

"I will handle them." The words came out steady, not dramatic, the way a Queen names a decision she has already made.

He hesitated. She lowered her voice, just for him. "Joseph. Stay."

It was not a plea performed for the living. It was a small, private moment cut from the noise. He met her eyes, and the answer rested there long before he spoke. Joseph let the reins go and stared at Alexiana. "As you command, my Queen."

# Supplemental Chapter - The Torture Journal (Alexiana POV, First Person)

Joseph did not knock. He never knocked when the hour was too late for courtesies and the Reliquary slept with one eye open. He came in as if the shadows had trained him, soundless, exact, the leather-bound book held against his chest like a relic and a wound. The book was old, thick, and scored with shallow cuts that did not look like wear. It looked like someone had tried to open it with a blade and failed.

He set it on the table between us. The candlelight caught the raised grain and the iron clasp. It smelled of dry ink, old leather, and a cold that was not from the night.

"This was his," Joseph said.

I did not touch it. I watched his hand instead, the way his fingers hovered a breath from the cover as if his skin knew to pull back. His face did not move. The restraint was complete. It hurt like a confession.

"When did you find it?" I asked.

"He kept it in the Reliquary. Locked. I did not know it was there until the war shifted and he let me into his private archive." He did not look at me when he said "he." The Grand Maester was a shadow in the room even when the man himself was not.

He lifted his eyes to mine then. There was no plea in them, but there was a question I had learned to read: permission. Consent. The last defense he could still claim as his own.

"I want you to know," he said. "I want you to have the record. I can't read it again."

My mouth went dry. "And you want to leave?"

"I will stand guard," he said. "If you need me, call."

I nodded once. I would not ask him to stay. I would not turn this into another test of his endurance. He bowed his head a fraction, a gesture the court would have called deference. I knew it as relief.

When he was gone, the room felt larger and colder. The candle did not brighten it. The silence pressed in from the corners. I sat and put my palm on the cover and felt the cold through the leather as if the cold had been waiting for me.

I opened the clasp.

The first page held a title in the Grand Maester's hand. The ink was dark and precise, the kind of script that pretended to be neutral. There was no flourish.

GRAND MAESTER'S JOURNAL: PREPARATION OF SUBJECT

I read the first entry.

---

Day 1. The child was taken at dawn. The household did not hear. The ward on the Vale estate was weak where the old river runs; the sentry pattern is predictable. I took the firstborn without the need for lethal force. He woke once on the road. He did not scream. He asked for his mother. I did not answer. He asked for his name. I told him he would earn a new one. I bound his wrists to keep him from reaching for the door. He did not fight then. He stared at the sky as if the sky could testify.

---

My hand shook on the page. I had read the contract. I had heard the confession. I had built a life around the gap between those facts and what I could not bear to see. Now the gap was a page I could not stop turning.

Day 2. He has not eaten. He will not speak to me. He asks for the Queen he is promised. He asks if she knows he is gone. He attempts to bargain. He is not broken. Good. I will not break him into a husk. I will make him a wall.

Day 3. He tried to run. The corridor doors were warded. He slammed his shoulder into stone until he bled. I let him bleed. He watched the blood on his palm and asked, "Does she bleed for me?" I said no. He laughed once, a thin sound. I do not like it.

Day 5. I allowed him to write a letter. I did not send it. I told him it would be delivered when he learned obedience. He wrote it anyway. He used her full name. Princess Alexiana Brienne Romera de Astraea. He wrote it carefully, as if each syllable was a promise he could keep her with. He does not understand that I have already taken it out of his mouth.

Day 7. I removed his boots and left him on the stone for the night. Cold is honest. It does not flatter, it does not bargain. He shook until morning and did not cry. I told him it was the cost of survival. He asked if she would pay it. I told him she already had. He did not believe me. He is stubborn. It will keep him alive.

Day 10. He refuses food unless I tell him the truth. I tell him the truth: he was bound in ink to a throne that cannot survive without a deterrent. He is that deterrent. He is not her consort. He is her shield. He looks at me as if he can cut me with his eyes. He cannot. Not yet.

Day 12. The first binding. I took his wrist and drew the line. He did not understand the mechanics. He understood the violation. He fought. He bit. He called me a thief. I am a thief. He spat blood on my boots. I did not wipe it away.

---

I pressed my fingers against my lips. The candle trembled. My breathing went thin and sharp, as if the words were a collar around my throat. I could hear the river again, the one I had never seen, the one that gave him away. I could hear his mother's door not opening because she slept and trusted the ward I had sworn would hold.

I kept reading.

Day 15. The boy's hands are raw. He clenches them to hide the shaking after each session. He tries not to show pain in front of the other acolytes. I have told them he is a foundling. They believe me. They do not ask how a foundling knows the queen's name.

Day 17. I removed him from the hall after he struck another boy who called him "pet." He was right to strike. He is learning that restraint without dignity is only obedience. We need restraint with will. I put him in the Reliquary crypt and left him in the dark for a night. He did not cry. He did not pray. He waited. When I returned, he asked me if waiting was a test. I said yes. He said, "Then I passed." I said, "You survived."

Day 19. First marrow pull. He vomited. He shook. He bit through his sleeve to keep from calling out. I made him hold the posture. I made him count his breaths. He asked if she could feel it. I told him no. I lied. If she were here, she would feel it through the bond she does not know exists. She would break the world to stop it. I cannot allow that.

Day 22. I left him awake for two nights. The compulsion does not hold if the body is already failing. He stood anyway. He asked to sleep on the floor at my feet. I told him no. He slept upright in the corner and woke on the fourth bell. He did not ask again.

Day 24. The child asked me what a Death Knight is. I told him: a living anchor for the dead. A restraint on a force that would otherwise consume the world. He asked who decided he would be that. I told him the world decided. He laughed. It was not kind. It was not a child's laugh.

Day 27. He tries to make me look at him when I speak. He does not want to be spoken around. I forced him to kneel. He did not. I used the compulsion. He fell. He did not forgive me. Good. I do not seek forgiveness.

Day 29. He began to flinch before the cold touched him. Anticipation is a weapon. I let him feel it. He stopped flinching on the third cycle. He is learning to make his body a place he can live in.

---

My stomach turned. I set the book down and put my forehead against the wood of the table, as if I could steady myself by force. My hands were open. I did not clench them because I had to keep the pledge I had made in the hall: I would not break in front of him. But he was not here. This was the one room in the world where I could let the sound out.

It was not a scream. It was the thin, torn breath of someone who had held too long.

I lifted my head and kept reading.

Day 33. He begins to answer "yes" before he knows the question. It is a problem. He is learning to obey without thought. That is not restraint. That is dead weight. I stopped the session and made him write his own name until he could say it without flinching. He wrote the name his parents gave him. He wrote it ten times. He looked at me and said, "You can't take it if I say it." I told him he was right. That is why I will make him say a different one.

Day 36. I told him the name. Joseph. He said it sounded like a stranger. I told him he would be a stranger to the world. He said, "Not to her." I said, "She will never know what I do to you." He said, "Then she will never forgive you." I said nothing.

Day 38. I have begun to cut the war into his body. Not the blade. The memory. I show him the maps. I make him count the dead. I make him hold the ledger with his own hands until the numbers stop being numbers. He is quiet. He is not numb. He whispers the names of villages I have burned because I could not hold them. He was never there. He carries them anyway.

Day 41. The first echo. It took him. It tried to climb through him. He screamed. The scream did not leave the room. I put the ward on the door myself. The scream was a living thing. I held him down and forced the echo back into the bone. I told him this would not happen in public. He asked me if it would ever stop. I told him no. It did not.

Day 43. He asked me to let him die instead. I told him death was a release he had not earned. He stared at me like a man already old. He said, "You are wrong." I told him, "I am necessary." He did not nod. He did not consent. He stayed because there was nowhere else to go.

Day 46. I take him to the chapel. I tell him what the oath will mean. He asks me if he can refuse. I tell him he can refuse and the world will end. He says, "Then I have no choice." I say, "No one does." He looks at me and I can feel the hate, clean and sharp. I accept it.

Day 49. The restraint drills begin. I make him hold his hand over a dying candle until the heat is unbearable and then withdraw it without extinguishing the flame. I make him stand between a shouting priest and a sobbing acolyte and do nothing. The world will ask him to hold when everything in him wants to cut. He must learn to hold.

Day 52. He does not cry anymore. His body has learned the schedule. His eyes have not. He asked me, "Does she know my eyes?" I told him, "She will know what you show her." He said, "Then I will show her nothing." He made a weapon of his face.

---

There were pages of it. There were days I could not have named. There were days I had lived through in ignorance, lifting a crown, giving a command, smiling at a court, while the boy who was promised to me had been turned into a weapon by a man I had called a guardian.

The journal did not apologize. It did not soften. It did not excuse. It recorded.

Day 58. The marrow pull returns as an anchor. He is stronger. He can hold. It costs him more each time because he understands. He does not break. I am not sure if I want him to.

Day 61. The lesson of consent. I told him: your power is not yours to unleash. It is the world's to request. If the request does not come from the Queen, it does not exist. He asked me if I would do this to her. I said, "No." He said, "Then do not do it to me." I did not answer. It was not a question I could afford.

Day 64. I let him see the kingdom through the east tower. Smoke on the horizon. He asked if she was safe. I told him she was. I told him the truth for once. It did not ease him. It made the leash visible. He pressed his forehead to the stone and whispered a promise he would not let me hear.

Day 67. He will not eat unless I read him the contract. I read it. He listens. He learns the weight of the title. He says, "So I was never hers." I say, "You are what she needs." He says, "That is not the same." He is right. I do not say it.

Day 69. He found the letter I did not send. I had kept it. I do not know why. He read it. He did not ask me to send it again. He burned it in the brazier. He said, "If she never knows me, then I will become what she must have." He turned away from me. I did not stop him.

Day 73. He woke choking from a dream of the river. He said, "Do you hear it?" I said no. He said, "Then you will not be spared." He was right. I will not be spared.

Day 77. The oath is near. He shakes in his sleep. He does not wake when I enter. He dreams of a woman with a crown he has never seen. I do not touch him. I watch. I know I am creating a bond that will be his chain and his salvation. I am not sure which I want more.

Day 80. He stands in the hall. He does not look at me. He does not look at anyone. He looks at the altar and speaks the oath with a voice that is not a boy's voice anymore. He says: I consent. I bind. I hold. I will not take what is not given. I will not break what is not mine to break. I will stand until the Queen releases me.

He takes the oath. It holds.

---

I had to read the last line twice. My eyes would not stop blurring. I pressed my hand to the ink as if I could feel the moment through it. The same oath I had heard in his mouth later, the same restraint that kept him from taking, kept him from asking, kept him from coming closer unless I called him forward.

The journal ended there. No flourish. No closing. The Grand Maester had not written what came after, because what came after was the person he had made. What came after was Joseph, the man who had just placed this book in front of me and left to stand guard as if his body were the same thing as a wall.

I sat in the candlelight and let the grief move through me like a tide I had been holding off. I did not let it take me. I did not let it drown me. I let it speak. I let the anger come without turning it into a weapon. I let the shame sit where it belonged.

I am her Queen, the book had taught me to say. I am her shield, the oath had taught him to say. And in the space between those two sentences was the boy who had been stolen so that I could stand here and read his theft without the world ending.

I closed the journal. The clasp clicked. It sounded like a gate closing, and I knew it was not the end of the story. It was only the record of the beginning.

When I stood, my knees did not shake. My anger did. My love did. I set the book on the shelf in the corner of my war room, where I could see it whenever I looked up from the maps. I would not hide it. I would not let it become a secret again.

Outside, the hall was still. Joseph waited at his post. I went to the door, opened it, and looked at him. He turned his head. He did not ask what I had read. He did not ask for comfort or absolution.

I stepped close enough that my voice was only for him.

"You are not his instrument," I said. "You are not his theft. You are my choice."

He looked at me. The restraint held, but the edge of him softened. That was as much as he could give.

I did not ask for more. I said, "Thank you."

He bowed. I closed the door behind me and left the candle burning, as if the light could outlast the page.

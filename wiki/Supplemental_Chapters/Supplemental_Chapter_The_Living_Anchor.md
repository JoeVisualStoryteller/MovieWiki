### Scene

#### Scene One - The Threshold (Joseph, close third)

The chamber was empty when Joseph entered it.

Not abandoned - emptied. Stone drank sound. The air held the cold steadiness of a place that had learned not to expect breath. He set his gauntlets on the floor with care, side by side, as if the ritual itself might keep him honest.

The circle was faint, older than any oath he had spoken. He knelt anyway. The candle flames dimmed, not by his will, but because something else answered first.

The dead were close tonight.

Too close.

He had not called them. That was the danger. The weight behind him gathered without footsteps, the sensation of being known too well. A pressure at the edge of his mind, gentle as a hand that had no heat.

You are tired.

It was not a voice. It was certainty.

Joseph's fingers flexed against the stone. The scars along his ribs pulled, a weight he could feel without touching. "I did not summon you."

No. But you are open.

It was true. Weeks of fighting had worn grooves into him. Too many nights awake. Too many reports delivered in the same deadened tone. Too many moments where his armor felt lighter than the silence inside it.

The pressure eased closer.

You carry us so carefully, yet you refuse our rest.

Rest. The word landed dangerously. His shoulders sagged a fraction - the smallest betrayal of posture - and the circle brightened into visibility. Cold gathered at his wrists and climbed toward his throat. He could feel it now: one step further and the dead would not just speak. They would hold him.

We would keep you, as you keep us.

The offer was not domination. It was belonging.

Joseph swallowed. His hand drifted up without permission, palm hovering above the stone. Power pooled there - effortless, eager. No more unanswered questions. No more waiting. No more reaching for something the living could not promise.

What do you still want that death cannot give you?

The question was old, a training echo he had carried for years. It landed now like a blade set against his throat.

His fingers trembled.

For one terrible moment, he let himself imagine it. Stillness. Certainty. No ache when her name surfaced unbidden. No weight in his chest when he returned alone.

Then he pulled his hand back as if it had touched flame.

"No," he said - loud enough that the word scraped his own ribs. The circle flickered.

Why resist what would ease you?

Joseph rose, breath uneven. He pressed his bare hand to his chest, grounding himself in the ache of a living pulse.

"Because ease is not living," he said.

The cold recoiled.

He turned to the narrow slit of window above the circle. Dawn had not reached it yet, but it would. It always did. The living did not offer certainty. They offered return.

She does not owe you certainty.

He did not name her. He did not need to. The wanting was enough. The wanting was the line.

"If I stop wanting," he said quietly, "then I am already with you."

Silence held a moment longer, then eased like fingers uncurling from a grip they did not want to release.

You walk a cruel path.

He slid his gauntlets back on and felt the weight settle him. "I walk it awake."

The chamber returned to emptiness. When he left, his steps echoed - uneven, human, real - carrying with them the ache he had chosen not to surrender.

#### Scene Two - The Living Hand (Alexiana, close third)

The gallery overlooked the inner courtyard, its arches open to morning air. Light spilled across pale stone and caught in banners hanging motionless in the stillness.

Joseph stood at the balustrade, hands on the cold stone, armor unfastened at the throat. He had not slept. The night clung to him as absence, not shadow.

"Joseph."

Her voice was not sharp. Not ceremonial. Just there.

He did not turn immediately. His body knew her before his mind allowed it. Alexiana approached without guards, a simple mantle pulled tight against the chill. There was a thinness to him she could not name - a kind of distance that was not defiance, but danger.

"You missed council," she said.

"I know."

His voice sounded distant to his own ears.

She came to stand beside him, forearms resting on the balustrade. Close enough that the warmth of her presence registered before anything else did. She did not look at him right away. That mattered.

"They're planting new trees," she said, gaze on the courtyard below. "In the southern quarter. I passed them this morning."

Joseph stared at nothing. The temptation of numbness tugged at him - the quiet certainty of becoming useful without being present.

Alexiana reached out and took his hand.

Not with ceremony. Not with intent. Just fingers threading into his, as naturally as if they had always belonged there.

Joseph froze. His breath hitched - sharp, involuntary - like his body had been pulled back from the edge of something deep.

Her hand was warm. Alive.

"They lost too many in the fires," she said. "Someone decided the city needed roots again."

Roots. The word settled into him like an anchor.

She finally turned to look at him - really look - and her brow furrowed just slightly. "You don't have to disappear to be useful," she said. "You know that, don't you?"

Joseph swallowed. "I don't disappear."

She met his eyes. "No," she said softly. "You endure."

Something in him loosened - not all at once, but enough. Sound rushed back in: birds, footsteps, the wind moving cloth. His pulse thundered under her fingers, unmistakable, undeniable.

She did not know what she had interrupted. She only knew the air had been too thin, and her hand had steadied it.

In the moment, she simply held his hand a heartbeat longer, then released it as if it were nothing. "Come to council," she said. "If you can."

She left him there in the morning light.

Joseph remained at the balustrade, fingers still warm where hers had been. The ache did not vanish. But it no longer pulled him toward silence.

#### Scene Three - The Weight She Did Not Share (Alexiana, close third)

The chamber was dark when Joseph entered. Not ritual-dark. Not death-dark. Just a room where someone had been sitting too long with their thoughts.

Alexiana stood near the hearth, crown set aside on the mantle, fingers clenched in her sleeve. The room smelled of ash and old paper. She had been reading the same line for an hour and not taking it in.

"You should be resting," she said.

"So should you."

"I don't have that luxury tonight."

Joseph did not argue. He set his gauntlets down - deliberately, audibly - then stood beside her, not in front, not behind. With her.

"What's pulling you away?" he asked quietly.

Alexiana's jaw tightened. For a moment, he thought she would deflect - command, dismiss, outmaneuver. Instead she exhaled, the sound thin but real.

"I keep thinking if I stay still long enough," she said, "everything will fall apart around me."

Joseph placed his palm flat against the stone wall beside hers. Solid. Cold. Real.

"Then don't stay still," he said.

She let out a soft, breath-thin laugh. "That's your solution to everything."

"It's my solution to disappearing," he replied.

Alexiana turned to face him. Her eyes were tired - not weak, burdened. "I don't get to break," she said.

Joseph met her gaze, steady and unyielding. "No," he said. "But you get to lean."

She hesitated - just a heartbeat - then rested her forehead against his shoulder. Joseph did not move, did not tighten his grip, did not say anything to fix her. He simply stood - breathing, present, alive - a weight the living world could rest against.

After a long moment, Alexiana's shoulders eased. "You're very good at this," she murmured.

"At standing?" he asked.

"At reminding me I'm not alone."

Joseph looked down at her, voice low. "You did the same for me," he said. "You just didn't know it yet."

She did not answer. She did not pull away either.

They stayed like that - no magic, no vow, no witness - only the quiet decision to remain.

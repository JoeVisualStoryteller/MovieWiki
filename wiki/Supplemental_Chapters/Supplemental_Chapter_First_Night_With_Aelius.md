# Supplemental Chapter - The First Night With Aelius (Alexiana POV)

### Placement
Pre-Joseph's return, after the political wedding. A private night that tests duty, restraint, and longing.

### Scene
Aelius came to my chambers without announcement. He wore no crown, only a plain tunic and the tired formality of a man who had been given a role he did not ask for. The palace was quiet in the way it only becomes when ceremony ends and the corridors empty. The torches had burned low, the air smelled of wax and watered wine, and I felt the weight of the day in every bone.

"May I?" he asked, and it was the first time I heard him soften his voice for me. Not the council's King Consort, not the man who fenced me with doctrine, but the one who would now share my bed.

"Yes," I said. It was the only answer a Queen could give in the first night of a marriage that was not love.

He stepped close and touched my hands as if they were delicate, as if they did not carry the weight of a realm. He kissed me with care, not hunger, and still it burned. I let him lead. I let him unlace my gown. I let him undo the pins in my hair and lay the crown aside with his own hands.

"I will not shame you," he murmured, and it was formal and true. He looked at me as if I were a contract he intended to honor.

I nodded and let him lower me to the bed. The sheets were clean and cold. His hands were warm. When his mouth found my throat I closed my eyes and kept my face still. He kissed along my collarbone, down the line of my chest, slow and deliberate. He took his time. He asked once, low in my ear, "Are you ready?"

"Yes," I said again. The word tasted like duty. It tasted like consent.

He pushed my thighs apart and slid his fingers between them, testing, patient, until I was wet enough to take him. He pressed the head of his cock against me and paused, his breath steady on my skin. "Tell me if you want me to stop," he said.

"I will," I answered, and it was the most honest thing I said all night.

He entered me and I took him in, inch by inch, until the pressure settled into a steady heat. I breathed through it. I kept my voice quiet. He moved with a careful rhythm, his hands at my hips, guiding, leading, setting the pace. It should have been enough.

Instead, my mind drifted.

I saw Joseph's hands in the dark, the way they would hover before they touched, the way he would ask before he took. I felt the memory of his restraint like a phantom at my throat. I could almost hear him breathe, almost feel the weight of his armor beside me instead of the man who held me now.

I did not say his name. I did not let my face move. I fixed my gaze on the canopy and held the line of my mouth as Aelius thrust, steady and formal, and the bed creaked under the weight of our vows.

He lifted one of my legs over his arm and went deeper. The stretch made me catch my breath. He watched my face, searching for hurt or refusal, and I gave him neither. I gave him a small nod, and he took it as permission to continue. He changed the angle again, rolling me to my side, his body close behind mine, his hand on my hip to keep my pace. I let him. I let my body answer even as my mind pulled away.

I counted the beams in the ceiling in my head, then the breaths between his thrusts, then the quiet seconds between my own heartbeat. It was a small dissociation, a distance I took without leaving the room. I let the pleasure build, and when it crested I bit the inside of my cheek and swallowed the sound.

Aelius did not rush. He held himself back until he heard my breath break. Then he let go, pressing his forehead to mine as he finished, his hands braced on the bed like a prayer. He stayed inside me for a moment, still and silent, until the tremor in his body passed.

When it was done, he did not roll away. He stayed, his arm around me, his palm on my hip. He cleaned me with a cloth from the basin, slow and careful, as if tending a wound that did not bleed. "Are you all right?" he asked.

"Yes," I said. It was the third time. It was as true as it could be.

He lay beside me and stared at the ceiling. I could feel his breath even, his body already relaxing into sleep. I watched him in the dim light and wondered what kind of man he might have been if the realm had not demanded this of him. I wondered what kind of woman I was for letting it happen while I still carried Joseph like a bruise behind my ribs.

I turned my face to the window, to the city beyond, and thought of the Black Reliquary and the man who slept there without knowing my name was spoken in the dark.

Aelius fell asleep. I did not. I lay still and let the silence settle around me like another crown.

In the morning I would be Queen again. In the morning I would stand beside my Consort and let the court believe in the fiction they needed.

In the dark, I held my breath and let myself miss the man who was not mine to keep.

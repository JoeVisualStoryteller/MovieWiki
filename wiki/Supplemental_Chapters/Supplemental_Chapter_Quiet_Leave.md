# Supplemental Chapter - Quiet Leave (Alexiana POV, First Person)

I did not ask for mercy. I asked for air. For a night that did not smell like ink and smoke and worry.

It was a quiet hour when the court finally stopped knocking. The brazier had burned low. The maps were still open, red ink bleeding at the edges like a wound that would not close. I kept my gloves on because the cold felt honest, and because I did not trust my hands to remain steady without them.

Joseph waited at the door, helmet under his arm, cloak plain. He did not fill the doorway so much as hold it. The guard detail had been reassigned. The corridor beyond him was empty.

"Do you want to leave?" he asked.

He did not say why. He did not say for how long. He did not say anything about danger. He spoke so little that every word felt chosen. He asked me, and the question itself was the offer.

I closed the ledger. The silence in the room shifted.

He nodded once. "We go now."

He moved first, always two steps ahead, never far enough to lead me by force, never close enough to be seen as anything but duty if someone turned a corner. That was the kind of restraint he wore in battle, and it was the same kind he wore with me. He guarded my image as carefully as he guarded my body.

We passed through a service passage I had never used, a narrow vein that the castle's stone seemed to forget. The door at the end had no crest, no guard. He opened it with a key that should not exist. I did not ask where it came from.

Outside, the city fell away. The wind was clean and sharp. The river below was black glass. The wall behind us was a shadow of itself, a line that looked strong until you stood on the far side of it. My breath fogged and vanished. For the first time in days, I was not counting the bell chimes between reports.

He stopped at the edge of the trees. "We can go farther," he said. "Or we can stop here."

I looked at him, at the way he held his silence like a blade he chose not to draw. "Here," I said.

We walked without speaking. The ground sloped down into a narrow valley where the grass was winter-stiff and the soil smelled of iron. He chose the path with the least crunch, the least sound, the least trace. There was no Death Magic in it. No glow. No weight. Just a man moving with care.

I realized I had stopped listening for the city. The bells were gone. The mutter of the walls had faded. Only the wind remained, and my own breath.

We sat on a low stone that might have once marked a boundary. The city was a dim glow behind us. The stars were cold and sharp, the kind that made the world feel small and honest. He set his helmet beside him, still keeping his gauntlets on, still keeping the distance that said he would not take what I did not offer.

"How long do we have?" I asked.

He did not answer with a number. He did not pretend to.

"Long enough for this," he said.

That was all. And it was enough.

I let the silence stretch between us. It was not empty. It was full of all the things I could not say in court, full of the weight I wore when I smiled, full of the cost of every order I had given in the last week. I thought of the ration lines and the burned granaries and the faces of men who had looked at me like I could turn iron into bread. I thought of the ways I had been asked to be a wall, a blade, a symbol, and how rarely anyone asked if I was still a woman.

"They look at me and think I am the wall," I said.

Joseph did not flinch. "You are."

He said it without ceremony. Not praise. Not comfort. A fact. A charge. When he spoke, it was always like that. The fewer the words, the heavier they landed.

I pressed my palms into the cold stone. It reminded me that I was still a body, not only a crown.

"Do you ever wish you could say more?" I asked him.

He looked at me then, and for a moment the restraint in him softened, not broken but eased, as if he had loosened a glove.

"No," he said. "If I speak, I want it to hold."

That was the emotional intelligence of him. He did not waste language. He knew the difference between noise and weight. He knew when I needed a sentence and when I needed air.

I turned my gaze toward the city. "They are trying to turn the court against me."

"I know."

"And if they succeed..."

He did not let me finish. "They will fail."

There was no bravado in it. It was the same tone he used before a line held, before a siege broke, before a choice burned him. It was not optimism. It was commitment.

I let that settle. It did something to the knot in my chest that no council vote ever touched.

He lifted a hand, palm up, not touching me. A question.

I slid one glove off. I placed my bare hand in his. It was a simple contact, cold at first, then steady. I felt the slow certainty in him, the way his pulse stayed even when mine wanted to race.

"Say the word if you want to go back," he said.

Consent, as always. His restraint was not only in battle; it lived in the way he let me decide even when the decision was obvious.

We sat like that until the wind shifted and the city bell tolled once in the far distance.

He stood first. "We should return."

I did not want to. That was the whole point.

But I nodded. "Yes."

On the way back, he spoke only once more, and it was the smallest sentence in the world.

"You are not alone," he said.

It was not a promise of rescue. It was not a confession. It was a statement that made the city behind us feel less like a cage.

We entered the passage without a sound. He closed the door. The castle swallowed us. The weight of the crown returned to my shoulders as if it had never left.

But the air inside me had changed. I carried the silence we had shared like a hidden blade: not for violence, but for balance.

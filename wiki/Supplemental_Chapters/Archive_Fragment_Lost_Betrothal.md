### Extracted Text (hand-copied; damage noted)

> *…the undersigned recognize the strategic union of Crown and deterrent, binding Princess Alexiana to the firstborn heir of House Vale. The Crown acknowledges the necessity of restraint embodied and deterrence at the borders; House Vale acknowledges obligation to the Crown and its doctrine of consent…*
>
> *…the betrothed heir shall be fostered at court upon reaching ten years, trained under the Grand Maester in matters of restraint and statecraft; no Oath Magic shall compel him; no Paladin may command him; his duty is to the Crown’s consent alone…*
>
> *…marriage to be solemnized upon ascension of Alexiana to the throne, contingent on consent and political stability…*
>
> *…consummation shall occur in private and by explicit consent; refusal carries no penalty; coercion renders the union void…*

Margin note in a different hand (later): *“Withdrawn under emergency. Subject lost. Record sealed.”*

Burn mark across lower third; ink blurred beyond recovery. Wax flecks still embedded in the fibers; the parchment smells faintly of smoke and metal.

### Grand Maester’s Private Note (tucked into the bundle)

*The contract was broken to prevent a world-ending war. The child bound for Alexiana was taken and forged into a deterrent. The name “Joseph” was assigned to bury the deed. Consent was broken. No justification is offered; everything is recorded. If this is found, the Grand Maester is either dead or about to be.*

— Grand Maester Alaric

### Observations (by current archivist)

- The enclosed iron ring is inscribed with restraint oaths, child-sized—consistent with Death Knight initiates, not courtiers. A faint salt line suggests it was worn against skin, not kept as ceremony.
- The linen strip bears initials **J.V.**, not “Joseph.” Likely original name of the heir.
- Removal from rolls appears political, not clerical. Corroborates rumor of a “lost betrothal” and the Grand Maester’s subsequent secrecy.
- Exposure of this document would undermine the taboo narrative that no monarch has ever bound to a Death Knight; intent predates doctrine panic.
- The explicit consent clause predates modern reforms by decades, suggesting the Crown anticipated taboo and codified restraint at the source.

**Access:** Restricted to reigning monarch, Grand Maester, and their designated heir. Unauthorized possession punishable by exile or worse.

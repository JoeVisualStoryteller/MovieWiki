## Interlude — Wall of Echoes

### Placement

Between Chapters 10–11, after the siege of Astraea. The living need time to replenish. Council, crown, and trade delegations demand visible defense. Alexiana hates the optics; Joseph bends to necessity, erecting an army of willing echoes in public view at severe personal cost.

### Scene

Midday, on the inner parapet. Delegations from fringe states watched with eyes weighing grain against fear. The council pressed for a spectacle. Alexiana stood rigid, jaw clenched, her crown a weight she did not set down. No consultation, no vote—no warning from the King Consort, the Paladin, or the Council.

Joseph stepped onto the wall, helmetless. He did not speak to the crowd; he faced the killing fields. Muramasa remained sheathed. He breathed once, twice, voice low and flat.

“Who will stand one last time?”

The air thickened, cold layering over spring sun. Frost kissed the stone. From the edges of hearing, armor clinked; pale figures coalesced—archers, pikemen, cavalry without horses but with discipline. Their eyes were hollow light, not stolen fire; they nodded, consent given. Alexiana’s breath caught at the first rank on her wall; surprise flashed before she reined it in.

Citizens flinched, then stilled. Children whispered. A trader dropped a ledger. The Paladin champion’s knuckles whitened on his hilt.

A guard arrived at a run, breath ragged, eyes on the forming ranks. “Majesty—he’s gone mad. He’s raising the dead.”

Alexiana did not look away from the wall. “Clear the stair,” she said. “Now.” She moved for the inner steps, the guard at her shoulder, officers scrambling to keep pace. The stair was a straight line and she took it like one.

At the stair door, the Grand Maester stepped into the way and planted his staff. “Enough.”

“He did not have my consent,” Alexiana said, hard.

“He has mine,” the Grand Maester replied. “I authorized it. We need a wall the living can see.”

She stopped a pace short of him. The air already tasted cold. “You had no right to bind my city to a spectacle.”

“I had every duty to keep it standing,” he said. “This is restraint, not dominion.”

Alexiana held his gaze, the argument burning and unsaid. Then she broke past him. If the echoes were already rising on her wall, she would face them there—not from below.

Hours stretched into the full day. The echoes stood as silent wards along the wall, bows ready, spears braced, buying time for the living to rotate, drill, and take their places. The intent was not a single display but a bridge of days—however long it took to train replacements who could hold without him. Joseph’s eyes glowed, guttered, then glowed again. Sweat froze on his neck despite the sun. He was still injured and recovering; this was a risk he should not have been able to take.

The Grand Maester murmured, “Release them,” more than once. Joseph shook his head slightly. He kept them stable until the living could stand again.

By dusk his hands tremored. A thin line of blood ran from his nose. The echoes flickered at the edges. Citizens saw it—the cost made flesh. Whispers turned from fear to a rough, reverent hush. When the echoes finally thinned, Joseph did not recover quickly; it took him the day to stabilize after spending that much again so soon.

Alexiana’s jaw set when she looked to the Grand Maester. This was not her consent; it was taken by omission, forced by timing. She kept her anger on a short leash because the wall could not afford her to break in public.

She stepped forward, voice low but carrying. “You have seen enough.” She looked at Joseph. Permission and command in one.

Joseph exhaled. “Thank you,” he said to the echoes. They bowed—disciplined even in departure—and dissolved like ash in reverse.

He dropped to one knee, catching himself on the parapet. Alexiana’s hand hovered; he nodded, and she steadied him. Councilors bit back accusations; the display already bought them what they wanted—trade signatures, a day’s morale, a myth sustained.

No living were compelled, no necromancy practiced. Echoes were willing, called and released by consent. The taboo groaned under the weight of what was shown, but the city slept with ghostly sentinels in memory, and the living trained one more night without bearing the wall alone.

# Supplemental Chapter - The Scrolls (Alexiana POV)

### Placement
After the secret bond in the Black Reliquary. A quiet, ceremonial gift before they leave the ritual space.

### Scene
The ceremonial hall smelled of wax and cold stone. The ward still hummed in the walls, a thin blue line sealing the room from the rest of the world. Alexiana stood with Joseph at her side, the vow still warm on her skin, the crown set aside on a bare altar. The Grand Maester did not smile. He simply stepped forward with a small iron casket held in both hands.

"For you," he said.

He set the casket on the stone and opened it with a key that never left his wrist. Inside were scrolls bound in black thread, their edges worn smooth by age. Alexiana reached toward them and stopped when he lifted his hand.

"They do not leave the Reliquary," he said. "Not for the Council. Not for the court. Not for the archives. Think of it as a wedding gift. Read them here. Keep them here."

Joseph said nothing, but his gaze held on the casket as if it carried a weight he had carried alone. Alexiana nodded once and lifted the first scroll. The vellum was thick, the ink dark and measured. The story did not begin with kings. It began with failure.

She read in silence, the words older than the stone beneath her feet.

"At the end of wars that would not end, the Order was assembled in desperation. We were not born of tradition but of necessity. We were few by design, forged by consensus, sworn to restraint. We ended wars by making escalation unaffordable. We did not rule. We did not conquer. We did not take what the living had not chosen to lose." 

She read on, the script steady and unadorned.

"Each Knight was bound to three disciplines: strike, barrier, and summons. One path was meant for one life. More was a cost, not a crown. Restraint was the chain and the key."

"We swore the Quiet Step and the Vow of Weight. We asked permission before power. We did not claim the living; we did not take dominion. The living must choose or be spared. The moment choice is removed, Death Magic becomes a violation."

"The body became record. Scars were our ledger; each use left a mark, each mark a limit. We carried the cost so the realm would not."

"We ended wars by breaking command, not by burning fields. We took oaths to leave no banners, no heirs, no thrones. We did not build a dynasty. We held a line and then we vanished."

She turned the page and the script tightened, as if the hand had not wanted to write it.

The next scroll shifted from doctrine to record, a campaign ledger written in the same spare hand.

"WESTERN CAMPAIGN: The Order intervened in border wars to prevent escalation into Astraea. Death Knights severed mustering lines, collapsed supply routes, and neutralized command nodes without razing civilian centers."

"Noted actions: broke sieges without occupation; dismantled oath-keeping circles used to compel levies; withdrew after surrender was secured."

"Joseph: in the days of his exile, he neutralized multiple Necrotic King command nodes and mustering forces. He destroyed the enemy's air arm - dragons - so resistance forces could move without annihilation. He withdrew without spectacle."

"EASTERN CAMPAIGN: The Order held the East against the first Necrotic King incursion. Death Knights acted as sole deterrent where living forces could not stand."

"Noted actions: cut command spines, denied reinforcements, opened evacuation corridors. Liberation was measured; it did not linger."

"Joseph: sole defender during the initial incursion. Neutralized Necrotic King command nodes and mustering forces; broke the chain of control. Liberated East-North, then East-South, and held Astraea through the siege. He destroyed the Necrotic King's enabling piece for the kingdom of Astraea, buying the realm its breath."

Alexiana's grip tightened. She read the line again, the years folding into a single, merciless ledger. He had carried a war she had not seen and returned without asking to be witnessed. She felt the shame of what she had not asked and the weight of what he had never said. It was not pride that rose in her throat. It was grief, and gratitude, and a quiet fury that the realm had made him do it alone.

"Success invited misuse. The Councils shortened recovery. They praised restraint in daylight and punished it by night. We were kept from family, from beds, from names. They called it doctrine. It was fear." 

The next passage was colder.

"One crossed the line. He took the living, not as enemy, but as solution. Dominion touched Death Magic, and the Order split. The Purge followed. Paladin Orders were empowered. Some surrendered. Some fled. Most died through attrition, betrayal, or overuse. The world decided deterrence was more frightening than war." 

Alexiana's grip tightened. She glanced at Joseph. His face was still, but his eyes had dimmed, as if the words were taking something from him that had already been taken.

The final scroll was a ledger of names and deeds, a narrow column of vows, strikes, and costs. The ink grew thinner as the list dwindled, until there were only two names left. The Grand Maester's at the top. Joseph's at the bottom. No birth name. No house. Only the record of what the Order had asked and what he had paid.

"This is the whole of it," the Grand Maester said quietly. "Who we were. What we did. Why we fell. It is not for the Council. It is for you."

Alexiana closed the scroll and set it back in the casket. She did not trust herself to speak for a moment. The room was too still. The weight of the record pressed against her palms as if it were alive.

Joseph turned his head slightly toward her, not touching, not claiming. The intimacy was in the space he did not cross. She reached for his hand anyway, a brief, private contact that made the ward feel warmer. He let her.

"I will read them," she said. "Here. With you."

The Grand Maester inclined his head once. "Good. The Order ends in silence unless someone chooses to remember it." He closed the casket and slid it back into the shadowed shelf. The ward hummed on, sealing the gift in stone.

Alexiana stood between the man who had made Joseph a weapon and the man who had refused to become one. The scrolls would not change what had been done. But they would keep the truth from being erased.

She looked at Joseph and then at the casket. "We will not let them burn this," she said.

Joseph's hand tightened once around hers. "Restraint is the line," he said.

"And memory is the other," she answered.

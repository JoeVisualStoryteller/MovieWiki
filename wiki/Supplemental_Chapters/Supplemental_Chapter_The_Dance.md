# Supplemental Chapter - The Dance

## Placement

Late Act IV / early Act V, after Joseph recovers and before the final battle. Public fiction still holds; this scene breaks it briefly in public.

## Scene

The ballroom had been built for weddings and treaties; tonight it held a war’s exhausted people.

Alexiana stood at the head of the room beneath the banners of Astraea, her crown set, her posture a mirror of the marble behind her. Nobles and servants danced in the same light, a deliberate mercy. Councilors spoke too loudly. Paladins allowed themselves the rhythm but not the joy. It was a morale event; it was a prayer, and she had authored it.

Aelius moved through the room with the ease of a man who knew how to lend the city his warmth. He danced with a noblewoman in a rose-colored gown, then another with silver in her hair. Their laughter held the edges of the room together, and Alexiana was grateful for it. She did not dance. She did not smile.

She watched the doors more than the floor.

Joseph had been brought back to the Reliquary, back to breath and memory, but she had not seen him yet. The healers had told her he would stand soon. The Grand Maester had said nothing, which was its own warning. Alexiana heard the music and thought of his silence, his stillness, his cost. She had let him spend himself again. *How do I keep him alive when his very restraint kills him?*

Her hand tightened on the stem of her glass. She could feel the eyes on her: the Council measuring, the Paladin accuser watching for the smallest fracture. She kept her spine straight and her face calm.

Then a gauntleted hand reached for her.

She turned before anyone else could see her startle. Joseph stood beside her in black armor without a helm, his eyes clear, his mouth set. He did not bow. He did not ask the room. He only looked at her.

“Majesty,” he said softly.

She should have refused. She should have asked for privacy, a corridor, a ward. She knew the rules they had written together. She knew what the Council could do with a moment like this.

He extended his hand again.

“I know what I’m doing,” he said, low enough that only she could hear. “You may punish me for it later. For now—let me enjoy you one last time, my Queen.”

He did not touch her until she nodded.

The room felt its breath change. The nearest couples stilled. The musicians hesitated, then recovered, leaning into the melody as if it had always been written for this moment. Councilors watched; no one spoke. Paladins tightened their grips on their goblets, waiting for a signal that did not come.

Alexiana placed her hand in his. The contact was public; the consent was private.

The floor opened without command. The dancers moved back as if drawn by a tide they could not name. Aelius continued to dance with the noblewoman, their steps matching the music, their presence a shield against immediate scandal. Two couples remained in the center of the room, mirrored by the chandeliers’ light.

Joseph guided her onto the floor. His gauntlet was cool through her glove. He did not pull. He did not claim. He let her set the pace.

“Yes,” she said, and meant it.

They moved in slow, formal time, the kind of steps that could be explained as duty, as theater. He held her at the proper distance. The closeness was in his gaze, not his grip. Alexiana kept her chin high, her expression calm, even as her ribs tightened with the ache of him.
For a breath, she let it go. She leaned into him—just enough to feel his armor, just enough to betray the restraint she had worn like a crown. The room did not break. Neither did she.

Around them, the city watched and did not recoil.

She felt the weight of the moment: not romance, but consequence. This was the public fiction flexing, not breaking—just enough to test whether the room would snap. It did not. It shifted.

Joseph’s voice was a breath near her ear. “I will return to the Reliquary after this.”

“You should not be here,” she murmured, formal and true.

“I am here,” he said. “This is not a battlefield. This is your people.”

Her throat tightened. “They were taught to fear you.”

“Then let them see what you chose,” he answered.

The Paladin accuser watched from the edge, jaw set. He did not step forward. A councilor opened his mouth, then closed it when Alexiana met his eyes. The room understood. Fear did not vanish, but it stopped commanding the air.

She did not let her fingers slide beneath the gauntlet. It was a dance and nothing more—and everything.

The song ended. The room exhaled.

Joseph lifted her hand and released it. He stepped back, three paces, the distance of restraint. The floor filled again as if it had never emptied, and the musicians began another tune with a cautious smile.

Alexiana did not look at the Council. She nodded once to Aelius; he returned it, still dancing, still playing the part they had written together.

Joseph moved toward the shadowed edge of the hall. Before he vanished, he looked back. There was no plea in his expression, only a quiet gratitude that sat heavier than any vow.

She did not follow. She could not.

She returned to her place beneath the banners and raised her glass, the queen of a city that had just made room for its deterrent without being told to. The rule held; the moment lived. The music continued, and for the length of a song, Alexiana allowed herself to believe that the city could learn a new kind of fear—one that did not demand distance as its only proof of safety.

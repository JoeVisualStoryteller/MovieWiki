# Scene XX1 — Sora Base Prompt

Ultra-realistic dark fantasy cinematic scene with grounded performances and restrained camera work. Lighting is natural and dramatic, with no exaggerated visual effects.

- The Queen, Roman-inspired with an olive skin tone and brown hair, stands confidently in the throne room issuing orders. She is composed and fully in command of the war; movements are precise and deliberate.
- Joseph, a fully human knight trained in death magic, stands beside her in obsidian-black plate armor. Face visible and uncovered. He is silent, disciplined, and alert, watching her movements and the room rather than the council. No magic is active.
- A battle-worn knight bursts through the throne room doors and drops to one knee, urgently reporting the King’s killer has been found on the battlefield—an enemy Paladin.
- Before the Queen can respond, Joseph moves. Motion is immediate and decisive, faster than anyone else but not supernatural. As he strides toward the doors without turning back, he says with calm authority: “I’ll handle this. Captain Varro—guard the Queen.”
- Captain Varro answers off-screen, firm and immediate.
- The Queen instinctively reaches out to stop Joseph, but he is already gone. She cannot catch up. Camera lingers on her as she lowers her hand, showing concern, trust, and the understanding that this confrontation was inevitable.
- No music swell. No magic effects. End on quiet tension.

**Usage notes**
- Optimized for Sora 2 Base; generate alone, not combined with other scenes.
- If doors reappear at the end, clip the final second in edit or specify an alternate exit corridor.
- Avoid visualizing Captain Varro; keep the response off-screen. Use reaction on The Queen to carry the emotion.

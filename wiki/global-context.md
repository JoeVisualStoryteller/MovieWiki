# Global Context

Dark, cinematic, ultra-realistic fantasy with somber, dramatic restraint. Emotional throughline: duty versus love, betrayal without malice, and restrained grief. Camera language is cinematic with slow pushes, controlled pans, natural lighting, realistic physics, and minimal VFX.

Two primary characters must be maintained across all scenes:
- **The Queen** — Roman-inspired noblewoman; olive skin tone; brown hair; intelligent, restrained, emotionally guarded; disciplined authority
- **Joseph** — fully human knight trained in death magic; weathered, stoic, emotionally repressed; transformation is painful and tragic, not monstrous

**Important Sora guidance**
- Keep both main characters referenced from Scene 1 onward, even when off-screen
- Avoid introducing new character descriptions later to preserve identity
- Do not over-stylize magic effects; favor realism and restraint
- Favor emotional weight over spectacle; use controlled motion and grounded performances

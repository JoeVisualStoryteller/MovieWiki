# PART I — LORE LAW
*(Immutable rules governing the world)*

## Core Truths
- The world is not saved; it is **delayed**.
- Power exists to test restraint.
- Choice matters more than outcome.
- Escalation is the true enemy.

## Magic
Magic is consequence redistributed, not energy.
Every act exacts cost.

Domains:
- Vital Magic — growth and healing; no resurrection.
- Death Magic — restraint, endings, deterrence; cost paid personally.
- Dominion Magic — control without choice.
- Oath Magic — belief-bound righteous force.

Dominion and necromancy are adjacent violations:
dominion enslaves choice, necromancy defiles finality.

## Death & Afterlife
Death is final.
Souls pass into **The Quiet**.
Resurrection is impossible.

## Necromancy vs Death Magic
Necromancy is illegal everywhere.
It is quantity over quality—a cheap imitation that violates finality.
Necromancy ignores cost and forges obedience through violation, not invitation.
The Necrotic King returned himself as undeath through necromancy, but necromancy alone cannot convert the living into undeath.
He wields a perverted form of Death Magic to strip the living of choice while they still breathe, seizing them and forcing them into undeath—this live seizure is what makes him near-god dangerous without godhood’s constraints or costs. This fusion is unique to him; no other necromancer has survived the attempt.

Death Magic does not touch souls.
It commands remains, memory, and residual will; using it on the living to remove choice is a dominion/necromantic violation, not true Death Magic.
Only willing echoes answer the call.
These echoes are not resurrected persons, but warriors who answer from the edge
of finality without crossing it.
Death Magic has cost and requires restraint.

Joseph does not raise the dead.
He calls to what remains at the boundary of finality:
“Who will stand one last time?”

## The Undead
- Visibly dead and incomplete
- Capable of speech, memory, and tactical reasoning
- Weaker than the living
- Cannot heal or evolve

Death Magic trades capability for endurance.
Joseph's summoned undead are higher-tier, willing echoes.
The Necrotic King's undead are mass-produced; only top commanders can speak.
Living-turned are fresher, stronger, and more dangerous, but less stable.

## The Death Knights
Death Knights exist to:
- keep gods honest
- prevent wars before they begin
- make escalation unaffordable

They are deterrents, not conquerors.

Doctrine:
- Power must be restrained
- Cost must be personal
- Consent matters, even in death
- No Death Knight may rule
- The Order must end when no longer needed
- Never turn Death Magic upon the living in any way that removes their choice; lethal force is authorized only after restraint and de-escalation have failed and the aggressor chooses to kill (e.g., the Death Knight attempts to disengage, the attacker persists with lethal intent, then a death strike is permitted). Wartime deployment against living forces requires explicit order from the reigning monarch and is used only when an armed aggressor chooses to attack or threaten the nation so the living do not have to bear war.
Violation of this doctrine is treated as dominion and invites annihilation.
Queen Cassandra will never authorize Death Magic that removes choice from the living.

## Strategic Doctrine of Death Magic
Death Magic annihilates escalation before it forms:
- leveling mustering forces
- erasing command structures
- collapsing wars overnight

Its purpose is prevention, not victory.

## Mythic Blades
Some blades wait for permission.
Others demand use.

**Excalibur** — Sword of Permission, borne by Paladins.  
**Muramasa** — Blade of Compulsion, summoned through Death Magic.

Muramasa is honest power.
In the hands of the unrestrained it becomes dominion.
In the hands of a Death Knight it becomes restraint.

## Foundational Figures
**The Grand Maester** — First Death Knight, over 1,000 years old. He kidnapped Joseph as a child from a betrothed path to Cassandra and forged him into the deterrent destined to face the Necrotic King.  
**The Necrotic King** — Second Death Knight, lost restraint, returned as dominion.

## Political Law
The Crown is a continuity engine.
Royal marriage is statecraft.

No reigning monarch may wed a Death Knight.
This prohibition is survival logic.
Enforcement is political: annulment, exile, or sanctioned removal.
The taboo exists to prevent a deterrent from becoming a dynasty.
No such marriage has ever occurred; it would be entirely new.
Courts and councils will not accept a Death Knight as king or consort.
Secret betrothals can be erased; records of Joseph’s intended role as Cassandra’s consort were buried when the Grand Maester took him.

## Council Doctrine
The Council treats Joseph as a weapon, property, and service—not a person.
They view Death Knights as existential threats that must be kept distant and deniable.
Fear drives policy: a Death Knight is seen as a nation-ending liability if unrestrained,
and as a political coup if allowed proximity to the Crown.

The Council exiled Joseph out of fear, framing it as “gratitude” and “optics.”
They prefer the deterrent to remain a rumor at the borders rather than a reality in court.

Cassandra is the shield between Joseph and the Council.
She absorbs their pressure, blocks their demands to deploy him as a weapon, and
prevents political forces from turning him into a tool of dominion.

When the time comes, the Council orders the Paladin accuser against the Queen.

# PART II — NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS
*(How the story must behave)*

## Joseph
Joseph is fully aware of his power.
If he abandoned restraint, he could annihilate nations.
He chooses restraint every day.
He was taken as a child by the Grand Maester from a future as Cassandra’s intended consort and put through brutal Death Knight training to face the Necrotic King.

## Cassandra
As Princess, Cassandra knows Joseph is dangerous but not the full extent.
As Queen, she learns through pattern, consequence, and refusal.
By the end, she knows enough to rule — never everything.
She protects Joseph fiercely—shielding him politically from councils and emotionally from being treated as a weapon, even as she asks him to serve.

## Knowledge Asymmetry
Joseph understands the full danger.
The Grand Maester understands the theory.
The Necrotic King understands the failure.

The world survives on partial truth.

## Hidden Origin
- Cassandra’s childhood consort had been selected: Joseph, before he became a Death Knight.
- The Grand Maester erased that path by kidnapping and training Joseph in secret, prioritizing deterrence over dynasty.
- Cassandra learns this late; it reframes their bond as both stolen and chosen.
- The Grand Maester carries guilt for violating consent to preserve the world.
- Joseph is later dismissed from court under political pressure and pushed into the wider war for years before his recall, deepening the gap and the cost of their reunion.
- Early foreshadow: sealed betrothal records, Cassandra’s stray recognition of Joseph, and the Grand Maester’s guarded archives.

## Orders
- Death Magic Order — extinct
- Paladin Orders — sanctioned, righteous, limited
- Living Knights — mortal, logistical
- Necromancers — outlawed, corruptive
- Paladin sub-antagonist: a senior Paladin who sees Death Magic as blasphemy and later accuses Cassandra of consorting with death, demons, and undeath; he embodies the “mistake corrected” rivalry between Orders.

No Order can replace another without catastrophe.

## Romance — Mutual Discovery & Sustenance (CANON)
Joseph and Cassandra are in love, and that love is never finished becoming.

Their bond is real, mutual, and developing.
It is never complete, never stable, never allowed to settle.

This bond has **never existed before**:
no Queen has ever chosen a Death Knight as a romantic partner.

They discover—slowly and cautiously—that their connection sustains restraint.

This is not Feeding.
Where Feeding stole future to extend power,
this bond preserves **coherence**, allowing Joseph to endure longer without escalation.

Cassandra does not give Joseph strength.
She gives him time.

Joseph does not draw power from Cassandra.
He remains whole longer in her presence.

They learn this through:
- proximity and absence
- controlled risk
- responsibility rather than indulgence

Love increases the cost of escalation,
but reduces the cost of endurance.

This discovery sustains Joseph until the final battle,
not by making him stronger,
but by preventing him from burning out too soon.

## Tragedy Structure
If Joseph escalates, the world ends.
If Cassandra chooses love openly, the world destabilizes.

They endure.
Others survive.

## Protagonists (Dual-Arc Engine)
Joseph is the physical lever of deterrence.
Cassandra is the political lever of continuity.

They do not replace each other.
They complete the same war from opposite ends.

## Antagonist
The Necrotic King is a former Death Knight who became a necromancer.
He believes he is a god and defiles Death Magic into necromancy.
He built his empire by seizing the living with perverted Death Magic and animating the dead through necromancy.
His rule is an explicit violation of Death Knight doctrine, which is why the
world treats him as dominion rather than a sovereign.
He rules an undead empire patterned on old Persia: vast, ordered, relentless.
He has completed conquest of the western hemisphere and turns east.
Sub-antagonist: the Paladin accuser—champion of Oath Magic—who hunts “death” influence inside Astraea, opposes Cassandra’s acceptance of Joseph, and forces a political trial of faith.

## Inciting Incident
The Necrotic King pushes into the Eastern Hemisphere.
Delay and restraint are no longer enough.
The deterrent must be seen.

## Stakes
Success: the Necrotic King is defeated, and Astraea endures.
Failure: the Necrotic King claims Astraea and the East collapses into dominion.

## Irreversible Choices
Joseph must decide to spend his life force in Death Magic to stop the undead.
Cassandra must choose between using her lover as a weapon or teaching the living
to fight the undead by another way.

## Midpoint / Final Arc Pivot
After Act X, the story enters its final arc.
From this point, restraint preserves life but not the future.

## Set Pieces (Canon-Consistent)
Use any 3–5 as needed:
- First eastern city falls; dead reanimate immediately.
- Black-armored figure glimpsed; the delay is proven possible.
- Necrotic King standoff: “Finally. A man worth killing.”
- Joseph’s overuse collapse; extraction under fire.
- Private reunion with consent formalized; love acknowledged, no forgiveness.
- Final battle: dominion offer refused, final cost imposed, dawn remains.

## Ending Modes (Options)
Canon: Joseph lives in peace with his Queen; they do not marry publicly, but he is Cassandra’s king and consort in all but title. Peace is provisional, not restorative.
Variant A (Bittersweet): Joseph sacrifices himself to defeat the Necrotic King.
Variant B (Survival): Cassandra unveils a living doctrine that makes Death Magic
obsolete, sparing Joseph at the cost of global upheaval.
Variant C (Tragedy): Joseph refuses escalation, Astraea falls, Cassandra survives
to lead a resistance in exile.

## Tone / Comps
Romantic tragedy with martial gravitas and mythic restraint.
Comparables: Tristan & Isolde, King Arthur, 300, Gladiator, and epic fantasy
romances, with sensual intimacy as contrast rather than spectacle.

# Director Notes (Screen Interpretation)
- Director pass: keep stakes legible, chain of command explicit, and the weight of Death Magic visible in light/sound and breath—restraint should read on camera.
- Visual language: Death Magic thickens air/sound; eyes glow on use; silence frames restraint before/after action. Reliquary is cold, low, stone, weighty—no banners, just names/oaths; use it for Joseph’s recovery and Cassandra’s private negotiations, never public.
- Astraea: containment-first visuals—mountains hemming the capital, austere interiors, columnar silhouettes, minimal ornament; crowd gaze is evaluative/female-gaze. Contrast NK’s mass undead (uniform, shoddy) with Joseph’s willing echoes (sparse, purposeful); living-turned look fresher and unstable.
- Blocking: Joseph moves helmetless and economical; shows restraint first, strikes surgically at command nodes. Cassandra stands between Joseph and council/military in public; in private, eye-lines and proximity/absence signal their coherence bond. Grand Maester stays in shadowed archives, guilt in pauses.
- Key beats to stage: eastern city falls with instant reanimation; aftermath of deterrent (black armor glimpsed) proving wars collapse overnight; Joseph’s overuse collapse during extraction; private reunion with consent formalized/no forgiveness; NK standoff (“Finally. A man worth killing.”) as doctrine collision; final canon end—public fiction (no marriage), private crownless king.
- Rules on screen: Death Magic vs living always shows attempted de-escalation first; lethal use is reluctant last resort and, in war, only on explicit monarch order. Distinguish necromancy (animates dead) from perverted Death Magic (live seizure/puppet with eye-flare).
- Tone & pacing: romantic tragedy + martial gravitas; contrast quiet touch/heavy armor, whispered oaths/battle roar. Escalation is expensive—every spell looks like paying a toll (breath loss, stagger, environment drains).
- Cameron pass (clarity & tactility): keep stakes legible in every set piece (clock, cost, line not to cross). Show chain of command—Cassandra gives the order, Joseph executes with precision; comms are terse and procedural. Make magic/war tactile: armor weight, breath frosting when Death Magic loads, walls trembling under undead impact, supply carts and fuel (grain) as mission-critical assets. Action geography stays clear: establish where the squad is, what objective they’re protecting/evacuating, how they extract. Between assaults, give human beats (quiet jokes, hand on shoulder) to bank audience emotion before the next hit. When Joseph spends power, show the meter drop—sweat, stagger, environmental dim; when he refuses to escalate, show what he’s saving.
- Stage threats to Cassandra visibly (stones, blades, poison, assassins, siege strikes); Joseph’s responses stay minimal and tactile (thin barriers, freezing steel, redirected force) to preserve doctrine.
- Keep siege geography legible: who defends, where civilians are, how commands flow.
- Romance blocking (restraint as intimacy): keep their bond private and unspectacular—small proximity shifts, shared eye-lines in crowded rooms, Cassandra stepping between Joseph and politics, Joseph dropping tension only when she closes distance. Consent is explicit (verbal or ritual) before touch; intimacy restores coherence, not power—he steadies, breath evens, eyes stop glowing. Absence hurts visibly: Joseph frays at the edges away from her; Cassandra’s composure hardens, more political armor. Public fiction (no marriage) vs private truth: play dual lives—formal titles in court, unguarded body language in shadows. Their romance is an engine for restraint; every kiss or touch should be earned after a cost, not casual. Gentle femdom cues are allowed only by explicit, enthusiastic consent and stay subtle (guiding hand, command tone in private); ownership is off the table unless both explicitly consent—and even then, it remains symbolic, never coercive.
- Romantic authority system (reverse-Gorean, female-gaze, mythic): nothing happens until Cassandra consents, and everything that follows carries her responsibility. She sets terms; Joseph never initiates escalation without her consent; her dominance is permission, not command, and is shown by outcome, not labels. Consent is explicit, revocable, and required before intimacy, restraint, or submission cues; absence of consent defaults to no power dynamic, and Joseph can refuse without punishment. Language stays declarative for Cassandra; Joseph offers agency-returning replies (“If you ask it,” “Say the word,” “I will, if you decide”), never ownership/dependency. Blocking: Cassandra controls distance; no public touch initiations; in private she allows space, he responds; touch stabilizes, never consumes; no grabbing/pinning. Power-exchange cues allowed only with explicit consent (private command tone, guiding hand, ritual deference, waiting for permission); forbid ownership language, humiliation, degradation, public dominance, sexualized coercion. Culturally: desire is private, authority public; their bond is singular, not a norm. Restraint/magic: Cassandra never authorizes Death Magic that removes choice; Joseph refuses escalation unless she consents and doctrine allows; love stabilizes coherence, not power. Romance stays developing, never lowers stakes, never excuses escalation or overrides consequence. Avoid genre labels in prose; use behaviors/ritual tone; dominance is situational and consent-bound. Final test: if Cassandra withdrew consent, the dynamic stops immediately.

## Author Notes (Narrative Emphasis)
- Dual internal monologues: Joseph’s coherence math vs Cassandra’s crown calculus. Political strikes against her force him to spend; every Death Magic use frays intimacy while proving their bond.
- Consent explicit; romance is restraint-as-intimacy (bedside vigils, hand steadies after blood, vows whispered). Paladin accuser drives pressure; Grand Maester reveal and lost betrothal are emotional landmines. Taboo is survival logic, not decoration.

## Screenplay Writer Notes
- Keep act turns tight to the 20-beat spine (illusion → delay → exile/recall → siege → parley → anchor → liminal duel → provisional peace).
- Set pieces to hit: bridge collapse, wall of echoes, western raid, Death Knight vs Paladin duel, NK parley, anchor pull/rescue. End chapters on turns (political consequence or relational shift).
- Maintain public fiction/private truth rhythm: every reveal threatens taboo; every cover buys time. Show chains of command clearly—Cassandra orders, Joseph executes with restraint—and always telegraph the cost clock.

# PART III — WORLD & CULTURE
*(How the world looks and feels)*

## The World
A single supercontinent divided by the **Great Rift River**,
a boundary of escalation and restraint.

## Astraea
Cassandra’s capital lies in the Eastern Hemisphere,
on the central coastline,
surrounded by mountains.

Astraea exists for containment, not comfort.

**Demonym:** Astraean

**The Black Reliquary:** An honored, sealed hall within Astraea reserved for Death Knights.
It is used for recovery, counsel, and restraint rites, and is kept out of public view.
Access is limited to the Queen or King and the Grand Maester; any attendants are sworn to silence.
No banners are displayed inside; only vows, names of fallen, and rites of finality.

The Reliquary sits at the lowest point of the castle: stone, cold, unforgiving.
Death Magic saturates the air; it feels like a room with ten times the normal weight.
It contains a healing chamber, a laboratory, and a training room designed for restraint.

Rituals:
- **The Quiet Step:** Entry is made in silence; no names are spoken until the door seals.
- **The Vow of Weight:** The Death Knight speaks a restraint oath before any use of power.
- **The Finality Rite:** A brief naming of the fallen before and after any summoning.

Taboos:
- No public audience is permitted inside the Reliquary.
- No political oaths may be sworn within it; only restraint vows are allowed.
- No Death Knight sleeps there without consent affirmed by the Grand Maester.

## Astraean Culture
Astraean society values:
- visible hierarchy
- embodied authority
- restraint over indulgence

Power is acknowledged and healthily embodied—consensual, mutual, never coercive.
Desire is private.
Authority is public.

Romantic expression is a reverse-Gorean style through the female gaze: authority is admired, not obeyed; ritual severity softened into gentle femdom/BDSM cues only by explicit, enthusiastic consent—no ownership, no coercion, never assumed.

It is a **female-gaze culture**:
observational, evaluative, power-literate.

## Astraean Dress
- Columnar, belted silhouettes
- Linen, wool, leather
- Minimal ornament
- Rank expressed through cut and structure

## Astraean Military Dress
A fusion of:
- Roman discipline
- Spartan severity
- Medieval knight practicality

## Joseph’s Armor
- Obsidian-black, matte finish; absorbs light rather than reflecting it.
- No helmet in battle; his helmet serves as an anchor and remains off unless ritual demands.
- Breastplate bears death markings in Astraean script (looks like Latin) that read as warnings and vows of restraint.
- Minimal ornament; functional lines; built for endurance over spectacle.

---

## Supplemental Scenes (Non-Canon Unless Implemented)
- Wall of Echoes: Joseph publicly summons echoes to buy the living time to rebuild after the siege; heavy cost visible.
- Western Raid: Off-the-books raid with echoes to seize grain/materials from NK logistics; doctrine intact, disobedience cost.
- Grand Maester Confession: Reliquary reveal of Joseph’s stolen betrothal and buried name; Aelius learns he is the substitute.
- Archive Fragment: Sealed betrothal contract with Maester note and archivist observations; emotional/political landmine.
- Death Knight vs Paladin: Dawn duel sanctioned to settle doctrine; Joseph wins while wounded, restraint on display, fuels later trial.

---

STATUS: **CANON LOCKED**
- Visual cue of activation: Joseph’s eyes glow with death energy whenever he wields Death Magic (summoning Muramasa, death strikes, barriers, or calls to echoes).
- Years-long exile between dismissal and recall to Astraea.
- Hidden origin timing: kidnapped from betrothal by Grand Maester, revealed mid-plot.
- Secret wedding timing and who knows (Paladin accuser excluded).
- Capital siege before Joseph’s return: he spends his remaining strength to summon a battalion (archers, phalanx defenders, knight infantry, undead cavalry) to save Astraea, then collapses.
- Joseph operates with a contingent of elite, consented undead echoes—small raiding cadres for surgical strikes on command nodes and supply lines; they raid and withdraw, never hold ground. Continuous use of Death Magic with these cadres drains him toward exhaustion.
- In Astraea, Joseph is a fan-favorite legend among citizens; they do not fear him and view him as a protector more than a monster.

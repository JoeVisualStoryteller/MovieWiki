## Canon Rules in Play

- Consent governs escalation; dominion over the living is forbidden.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana absorbs maximal exposure and converts it into controlled grief and resolve.

## Must-Include

- Joseph hands off the leather-bound journal and leaves to stand guard.
- The journal spans kidnapping through oath-taking with explicit methods and cost.
- Alexiana's response is intimate, intense, and restrained.

## Exit Condition

- Alexiana closes the journal and returns to command posture, intent sharpened.

## Notes

- First-person exception for Alexiana is intentional and limited to this supplemental scene.
- Placement target: around Act 19, after the confession and betrothal revelations.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.

## Emotional Target

- Revelation without spectacle; weight of sealed truth.

## Must-Include

- Betrothal contract binds Alexiana to the firstborn of House Vale (name redacted).
- Explicit consent clause: consummation by consent; refusal has no penalty.
- Grand Maester note: child taken; name "Joseph" assigned.

## Exit Condition

- Document remains sealed; risk noted.

## Notes

- Document-only artifact; no in-scene action.

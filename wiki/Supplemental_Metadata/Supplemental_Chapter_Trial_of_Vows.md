## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Dominion is a violation; no compulsion of the living.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Terror to tenderness; rage held by consent.

## Must-Include

- Rigged trial and public hanging sequence.
- Joseph drops Death Magic to spare the living crowd.
- Private reunion with consented intimacy and aftercare.
- Grand Maester confesses the abuses; duel follows.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph survives; Alexiana forgives him; doctrine reaffirmed.

## Notes

- Supplemental variant with full confession and duel.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Public bond remains taboo; no public affection.
- Death Magic cost and restraint remain visible even in aftermath.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: command regained over grief; the crown holds while the private wound deepens.
- Council/Paladin: fear clarifies into compliance; doctrine loses its comfort.

## Must-Include

- Joseph orders the hall secured and the rafters swept.
- Leto is removed with dignity by Alexiana’s order.
- Alexiana orders the breach framed as a security failure, not a public kneeling.
- Joseph warns the next strike will come somewhere softer and commits to the wall.
- Alexiana orders Leto to the Reliquary and refuses erasure.
- Alexiana keeps Joseph’s name private and carries it into her next order.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph leaves to hold the wall; Alexiana takes the next political step.

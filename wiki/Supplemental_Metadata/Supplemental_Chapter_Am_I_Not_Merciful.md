## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; dominion over the living is forbidden.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: restrained rage and humiliation, held under queenly control.
- Council/Paladin: fear of dominion disguised as doctrine.
- Necrotic King: cold, performative mercy as intimidation.

## Must-Include

- Necrotic King forces the entire royal line to their knees under guard.
- He does not attempt to turn them; he knows Joseph can undo the compulsion.
- Monologue explaining doctrine, conflicts, and resolution.
- “Am I not merciful?” lands as the final beat of the monologue.
- Joseph enters with Muramasa and Masamune drawn, intent to sacrifice himself.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph stands between the Necrotic King and the kneeling line, ready to fight.

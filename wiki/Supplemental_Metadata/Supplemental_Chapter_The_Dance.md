## Canon Rules in Play

- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; this scene breaks it briefly by design.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: duty held while desire pierces public restraint.
- Joseph: chooses a brief breach, accepts the cost.

## Must-Include

- Ballroom morale event with mixed classes.
- Joseph’s gauntleted hand invite; consent is private, contact is public.
- Floor clears; only Joseph/Alexiana and Aelius/noblewoman remain.
- Council and Paladins notice but do not interrupt.
- Dance ends with restraint reasserted and distance restored.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph returns to the shadows; public fiction holds, but the room has shifted.

## Notes

- This is a controlled, one‑song breach of public_affection for morale.
- No declarations; keep it formal and restrained.

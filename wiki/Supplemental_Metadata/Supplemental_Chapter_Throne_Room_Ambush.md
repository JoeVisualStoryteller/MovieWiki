## Canon Rules in Play

- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: composure under fire, fracture she cannot show.
- Joseph: silent restraint as protection, cost paid in the open.

## Must-Include

- East-North and East-South delegation conflict in council.
- Joseph shields Alexiana from arrows; barrier holds.
- Death strike collapses the hidden passage.
- Joseph summons twelve Death Knights and commands restraint.
- Joseph identifies the dissenter and rebukes the Paladin accuser.
- Joseph leaves the room with the healers.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph exits with healers; court left in stunned silence.

## Notes

- The embrace reads as guard-and-queen protection, not public affection.

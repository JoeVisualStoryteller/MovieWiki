notes:

  - Variant rewrite of the final battle sequence; keep aligned to canon rules.
---

## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Final neck scar severs summoning; only Alexiana understands its meaning.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: pride and fear held under queenly restraint as she watches him burn.
- Joseph: calm, sacrificial focus; restraint weaponized into command.

## Must-Include

- Necrotic King summons Joseph to the collapse ridge and promises a "trick."
- Joseph summons a mixed host and eleven Death Knight generals; only he sees the living woven in.
- Two volleys: first effective, second neutralized by enemy paladin wards.
- Enemy paladins revealed; Paladin accuser’s doctrine fractures.
- Joseph rides out with a small cavalry of undead and living knights.
- The Grand Maester rides with Joseph and strikes to open the death blow.
- Grand Maester’s strike staggers the Necrotic King; Joseph delivers the death blow.
- Council voices shift from uncertainty to recognition of the Necrotic King’s reach.
- Final neck scar forms after the return; Alexiana alone understands the cost.
- Alexiana orders a warded private moment; intimacy is gentle and consented.
- Council sees her devotion only by silhouette; no public affection.
- Joseph collapses post‑victory; the army is dismissed with honor.

## Exit Condition

- Alexiana orders Joseph back to the Reliquary; the cost is recognized but not announced.

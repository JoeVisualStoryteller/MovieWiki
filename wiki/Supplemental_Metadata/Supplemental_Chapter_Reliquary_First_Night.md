## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Gentle comfort; presence over urgency.

## Must-Include

- Door barred and ward raised before intimacy.
- Gentle bindings with consent check-ins.
- Aftercare and quiet ritual (tea, breath, stillness).

## Exit Condition

- Restraint reasserted; public fiction resumes.

## Notes

- Comfort anchor for gentle femdom dynamics.

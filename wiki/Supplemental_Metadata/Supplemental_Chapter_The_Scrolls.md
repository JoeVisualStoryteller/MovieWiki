## Canon Rules in Play

- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Records of Death Knights are controlled and often erased.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: quiet intimacy under duty; accepts the weight of record and memory.
- Joseph: seen without being claimed; the Order acknowledged without spectacle.
- Grand Maester: offers legacy, not forgiveness.

## Must-Include

- Scrolls are presented as a wedding gift and cannot leave the Reliquary.
- Excerpted story of the Order: creation, restraint, purge, and decline.
- Campaign ledger excerpt (Western/Eastern), including Joseph’s longest entry.
- Joseph present, silent, affected.
- Alexiana commits to reading and keeping the record in private.

## Exit Condition

- Scrolls are sealed back in place; Alexiana and Joseph leave the hall with quiet resolve.

## Notes

- Keep tone restrained and ceremonial; intimacy is in proximity, not spectacle.

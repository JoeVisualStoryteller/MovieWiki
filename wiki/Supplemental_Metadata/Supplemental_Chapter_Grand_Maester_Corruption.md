## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Anchor ritual has permanent cost when invoked.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- High-cost climax; love paid in blood.

## Must-Include

- Grand Maester corrupted and delivers Alexiana to the Necrotic King.
- Joseph is beaten by both Grand Maester and Necrotic King in the chapel.
- Rare ritual restores Joseph to full power; he kills the Necrotic King.
- Joseph dies after declaring love and honor.

## Exit Condition

- Corruption ends; Joseph dies; Alexiana left with the cost.

## Notes

- Climax variant; not canon unless adopted.

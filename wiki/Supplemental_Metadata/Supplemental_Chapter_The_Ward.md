## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; dominion over the living is forbidden.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: fear and gratitude held under queenly restraint.
- Council: witnesses the cost and necessity of Joseph's deterrence.

## Must-Include

- Council debates aid and terms; explicit tension over using Joseph vs protecting him.
- East-North and East-South are already devastated by the Necrotic King and rebuilding; alliance is harder but still necessary.
- Necrotic King binds the room and orders Aelius to kill if they do not turn.
- Everyone is forced to their knees at the onset of the turning.
- Aelius is compelled to move against Alexiana before fully turning.
- Aelius fully turns undead and is restored by Joseph's barrier.
- Joseph fights while exhausted; Grand Maester strike forces the Necrotic King to retreat.
- Alexiana calls to Joseph during the duel while maintaining queenly restraint.
- Alexiana silently thanks Joseph; Aelius shows new respect afterward.
- Aelius personally carries Joseph back to the Reliquary.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph collapses again; Alexiana orders the room secured and prioritizes his care.

## Notes

- Keep public affection forbidden; gratitude is private and controlled.
- Make the turning pain communal and visceral.

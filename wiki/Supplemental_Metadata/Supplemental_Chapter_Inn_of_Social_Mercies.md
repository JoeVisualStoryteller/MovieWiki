## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: learns the city's discomfort without indulging it; chooses private mercy.
- Joseph: accepts the attic without bitterness; intimacy is chosen, not claimed.

## Must-Include

- Multiple inns refuse or deflect; Alexiana sees the lie.
- Innkeeper explains customs without open hostility.
- Attic room is small, clean, and private; no regalia.
- Alexiana returns in disguise; explicit consent loop before intimacy.
- First sight of scars and the neck-warning moment.
- Aftercare and a quiet exit; restraint reasserted.

## Exit Condition

- Alexiana leaves privately; public fiction remains intact.

## Notes

- Keep gratitude indirect; offerings appear after he passes.
- No public affection; privacy is engineered and explicit.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Restraint is visible in word choice and action.

## Emotional Target

- Quiet relief without indulgence; Alexiana steadies under Joseph's minimal counsel.

## Must-Include

- Hidden exit beyond the city walls.
- Joseph's minimal speech carries weight.
- A consent check before touch or return.

## Exit Condition

- They return before dawn; secrecy preserved.

## Notes

- First-person exception for Alexiana is intentional and limited to this supplemental scene.
- Placement target: between Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 during peak political pressure.

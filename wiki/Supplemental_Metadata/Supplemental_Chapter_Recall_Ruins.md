## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.

## Emotional Target

- Joseph: command mode under ruin; duty overrides exhaustion.
- Alexiana: relief and restraint under shock; holds the room, then claims him again.
- Living: stunned by undead aid, fear turning into survival discipline.

## Must-Include

- On-page destruction of the capital (brutal, specific).
- Reliquary warded by the Grand Maester; Joseph forces it open.
- POV shifts from Joseph to Alexiana after the ward opens.
- Alexiana names restraint as the line even in ruin.
- Death Knight generals summoned; command sequence issued and echoed.
- Ward lowered for refugees; triage and civilian questions on-page.
- Joseph rides out despite artillery; victory cry heard.
- City shown scarred but standing; Alexiana orders him to stay.

## Exit Condition

- Joseph accepts the Honor Guard order and stays.

## Notes

- Keep public affection taboo even in crisis.
- The brutality is visible but not exploitative; focus on cost and consequence.
- Grand Maester's "you prefer it that way" line should seed Alexiana's suspicion.

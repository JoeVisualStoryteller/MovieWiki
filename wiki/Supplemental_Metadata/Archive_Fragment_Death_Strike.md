## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic does not touch souls; it commands finality.
- Death Strike leaves no wound and permits no reversal by healing.
- Consent governs escalation; dominion is violation.

## Emotional Target

- Paladin certainty destabilized by evidence; dread replaces doctrine.

## Must-Include

- No visible injury in subjects of Death Strike.
- Soul-sight reveals nothing displaced or torn away.
- Paladin concludes Death Strike behaves as final authority.

## Exit Condition

- Record sealed as Pre-Anathema; access restricted.

## Notes

- Document-only artifact; no in-scene action.

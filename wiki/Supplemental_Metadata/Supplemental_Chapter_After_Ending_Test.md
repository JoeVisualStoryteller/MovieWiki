## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Anchor ritual has permanent cost when invoked.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.
- Final neck scar severs echo summons; only Alexiana understands.
- The Necrotic King recognizes his death is final; no return.

## Emotional Target

- Relief without spectacle; restraint after victory.

## Must-Include

- When he reaches for the phalanx, only a few rise.
- Council tries to make him a tool; Alexiana blocks them.
- Private vows and bindings are consent-forward and quiet.

## Exit Condition

- They return to work; public fiction holds.

## Notes

- Post-finale variant; maintains taboo publicly.

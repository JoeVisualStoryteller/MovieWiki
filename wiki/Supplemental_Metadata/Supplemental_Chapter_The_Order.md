## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Dominion is a violation; no compulsion of the living.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: curiosity sharpened into early attachment.
- Joseph: silent restraint; irritation contained.

## Must-Include

- Grand Maester teaches the chronology: creation → weaponization → first violation → purge → survivors (as taught).
- Alexiana asks how many Death Knights existed at their peak; answer is 12.
- Alexiana asks why Death Magic takes so much; answer: they dance with death so others may live.
- Alexiana asks which power Joseph has; Grand Maester answers he holds all three.
- Alexiana mentions a rumor of a Death Knight saving Astraea; Grand Maester dismisses it.
- Alexiana asks for a demonstration; Grand Maester forbids it.

## Exit Condition

- Lesson ends with Alexiana resolved to learn more; Joseph remains silent.

## Notes

- Grand Maester controls the narrative, occasionally lying or deflecting.
- Joseph notices but does not correct him.

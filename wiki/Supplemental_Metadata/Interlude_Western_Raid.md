## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Urgency and restraint collide; cost paid off-stage.

## Must-Include

- Grand Maester authorizes the raid; echoes only, no dominion.
- Supplies secured under restraint (strike, withdraw).
- Alexiana threatens the Grand Maester for hiding the plan.

## Exit Condition

- Grain returns; political fallout lingers.

## Notes

- Place between ration collapse and bridge strike.

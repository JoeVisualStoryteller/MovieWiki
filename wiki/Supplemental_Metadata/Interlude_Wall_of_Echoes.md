## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Public spectacle strains taboo; restraint holds under optics.

## Must-Include

- Joseph calls willing echoes in public view.
- Alexiana confronts the Grand Maester over consent.
- Cost becomes visible (tremor, nosebleed, flicker).

## Exit Condition

- Echoes released by consent; wall holds, taboo strains.

## Notes

- Use for public-morale legend beats.

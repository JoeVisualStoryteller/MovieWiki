## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Oath Magic strains under taboo pressure.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Doctrine proven in combat; restraint shows visible cost.

## Must-Include

- "You cannot love a queen and wield death."
- Joseph refuses Muramasa after his eyes flare, then dim.
- Alexiana commands: "Yield."

## Exit Condition

- Paladin yields and leaves with grievance hardened.

## Notes

- Accuser escalates politically after losing in combat.

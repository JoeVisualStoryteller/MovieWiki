## Canon Rules in Play

- Return pressure is anchored in the living; doctrine guides but does not pull.
- Death Magic cost accumulates; refusal of certainty is survival.
- No public affection; intimacy is private and restrained.

## Emotional Target

- Joseph: tempted by stillness, chooses wanting.
- Alexiana: instinctive presence interrupts erasure.

## Must-Include

- Threshold temptation and refusal without doctrine invoked.
- Alexiana’s unknowing anchor moment (touch, warmth, ordinary detail).
- Later mirror where Joseph becomes her anchor through presence alone.

## Exit Condition

- Both remain living by choice, not certainty.

## Notes

- Composite vignette; spans post-siege, mid-campaign, and late-act night.
- POV shifts are labeled in the chapter; keep them close-third and physical.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: grief held in composure; resolve hardens.
- Parents: truth finally spoken, without spectacle.

## Must-Include

- Joseph is moved to the outer Reliquary where the city can see him.
- Parents recount the first time he saved Astraea and the treaty meeting.
- Dissidents attack; Paladin wounded; Joseph protects without compulsion.
- Promotion to Honor Guard for Alexiana is explained as the only vow allowed.

## Exit Condition

- Alexiana vows to carry the story and protect him as Queen.

## Notes

- Joseph remains unconscious throughout.
- Keep public affection forbidden; grief is private even if visible.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Civilians keep him housed apart; gratitude comes only after he leaves.

## Emotional Target

- Regret and restraint on a public day.

## Must-Include

- Alexiana sees Joseph in the crowd at her coronation.
- She searches and loses him in the palace corridors.
- Aelius brings Joseph's helmet; Alexiana defends it as a vow.

## Exit Condition

- She goes to bed with helmet and regret.

## Notes

- Early timeline beat; sets long regret.

## Canon Rules in Play

- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Duty and optics remain intact even in private scenes.

## Emotional Target

- Alexiana: duty upheld while grief leaks through; longing held under a queen's face.
- Aelius: formal care, leading with restraint rather than entitlement.

## Must-Include

- Aelius initiates and leads; Alexiana consents without spectacle.
- Alexiana masks grief; Joseph is present only in memory.
- Dissociation/longing is clear but not voiced aloud.
- Explicit, on-page intimacy followed by a return to restraint.

## Exit Condition

- Aelius sleeps; Alexiana remains awake, recommitting to duty at dawn.

## Notes

- Keep language formal and controlled even during explicit moments.
- No public affection; this is strictly private.

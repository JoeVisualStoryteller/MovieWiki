## Canon Rules in Play

- Death Magic cost accumulates; restraint limits escalation.
- Consent governs escalation; no dominion.
- Public bond remains taboo; affection stays private.
- Death Magic scars are permanent marks of restraint spent.

## Emotional Target

- Truth lands; authority held; fiction chosen.

## Must-Include

- Aelius: "I am the substitute."
- Alexiana: "Joseph was mine before he was deterrent."
- Grand Maester: "I do not ask forgiveness."

## Exit Condition

- Truth spoken; fiction kept to protect the realm.

## Notes

- Non-canon reveal scene; use as optional variant.

# Scenes

## Scene 1 – Council of War
Throne room, stone architecture, Roman-inspired banners. The Queen listens to a war progress briefing. She remains composed and emotionally guarded. After a measured pause, she calmly orders deployment of her honor guard—no dramatics, just authority.

## Scene 2 – The Shore
Desolate beach at dusk near a partially destroyed stick-built coastal house. A homeless man sits alone. Knights approach; he does not acknowledge them. Soft female narration: “I married for the crown… and left him to the tide.” He stares at the cold horizon.

## Scene 3 – Death of the King
Back in the throne room. The Queen learns the King has been killed in battle. The room goes silent. She absorbs the news without collapsing; breathing tightens. She rises—now Queen.

## Scene 4 – The Weight of Rule
War chambers and corridors. The Queen issues frantic orders. Voice remains firm but quickens; restraint fractures in subtle ways (trembling hand, slight pause). She stands alone inside power.

## Scene 5 – The Revelation
Forest at night. The homeless man is revealed wearing obsidian-black armor: Joseph, a knight trained in death magic. Memories surface; grief overtakes discipline. Eyes glow faintly; a restrained death-magic shockwave kills trees and life around him. No scream.

## Scene 6 – March of the Dead
Castle corridors. Joseph marches toward the throne room. Torches extinguish, plants wilt. Guards recoil. Camera pans to his face; eyes glow brighter. Without breaking stride, he blows the throne room doors apart and continues forward.

## Scene 7 – Reunion
Throne room ruins. Council freezes. The Queen recognizes Joseph; composure shatters. She runs to him, tears streaming, clutching and kissing his armor. He lifts his helmet just enough to kiss her back—soft, painful, everything unsaid. No dialogue.

## Scene XX1 – Authority and Instinct
Throne room, stabilized but war-worn. The Queen commands with confidence; Joseph stands beside her, silent and protective. A knight bursts in, reporting the King’s killer is an enemy Paladin. Before she responds, Joseph moves toward the doors, saying: “I’ll handle this. Captain Varro—guard the Queen.” Varro answers off-screen. The Queen reaches out to stop Joseph but he is already gone. Camera lingers on her reaction—concern, trust, inevitability.

# SORA MOVIE PROMPT — SCENE-LOCKED NARRATIVE

Use this as the unified prompt for the initial sequence (Scenes 1–7). Keep character descriptors in `characters.md` consistent and avoid adding new descriptors mid-prompt.

## Global Context (load first)
- Dark, cinematic, ultra-realistic fantasy with grounded emotional realism; somber and restrained tone
- Emotional throughline: duty versus love, betrayal without malice, restrained grief
- Camera: slow pushes, controlled pans, natural lighting, realistic physics; avoid exaggerated VFX unless explicitly stated
- Primary characters:
  - **The Queen** — Roman-inspired noblewoman; olive skin tone; brown hair; intelligent, restrained, emotionally guarded; power through discipline
  - **Joseph** — living knight trained in death magic; weathered, stoic, emotionally repressed; transformation is painful and tragic, not monstrous

## Scene 1 – Council of War
Throne room, stone architecture, Roman-inspired banners. The Queen listens as her council briefs her on a brutal war. She remains composed and emotionally guarded. After a measured pause, she calmly orders deployment of her honor guard. No music swell or dramatics—only authority.

## Scene 2 – The Shore
Desolate beach at dusk. A homeless man sits near a partially destroyed stick-built coastal house. Knights approach cautiously; he does not acknowledge them. Soft female narration: “I married for the crown, and left him to the tide.” The sea is calm but cold.

## Scene 3 – Death of the King
Throne room. The Queen is informed the King has been killed in battle. Silence falls. She absorbs the news without collapsing; breathing tightens. She rises—she is now Queen.

## Scene 4 – The Weight of Rule
War chambers and corridors. The Queen issues orders—troop movements, defenses, messengers. Voice remains firm but pace quickens; restraint fractures in small ways (trembling hand, a pause too long). She is alone, surrounded by power.

## Scene 5 – The Revelation
Forest at night. The homeless man now wears obsidian-black armor etched with death-magic sigils. He is Joseph, a knight trained in death magic. Memories surface—betrayal, duty, unspoken love. Discipline fractures into grief. Eyes glow faintly. A restrained death-magic shockwave erupts, killing trees and life around him. He does not scream.

## Scene 6 – March of the Dead
Castle corridors. Joseph marches toward the throne room. Torches extinguish, plants wilt, guards recoil but do not engage. Camera slowly pans to his face; eyes glow brighter. Without breaking stride, the throne room doors are violently blown apart by invisible force. He continues forward.

## Scene 7 – Reunion
Throne room ruins. Council freezes. The Queen recognizes him; composure shatters. She runs to him, tears streaming, clutching and kissing his armor. He removes his helmet just enough to kiss her softly—painful, as if afraid it is not real. No dialogue; only grief, love, and everything unsaid.

## Important Sora guidance
- Keep both main characters referenced from Scene 1 onward, even when one is off-screen
- Do not introduce new character descriptions later
- Avoid over-stylized magic; favor realism and restraint
- Favor emotional weight over spectacle; keep motion controlled and grounded

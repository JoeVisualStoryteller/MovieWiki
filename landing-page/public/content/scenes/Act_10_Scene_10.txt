FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

A living patrol is attacked. The dead seize a soldier mid-breath. He
stands again, still alive, eyes empty.

                              SOLDIER
                  He didn't die.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  He's not alive either.

Horror spreads. The patrol breaks.

FADE OUT.

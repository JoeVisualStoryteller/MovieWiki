FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra faces the GRAND MAESTER. The truth hangs between them.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I need the truth.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The truth is a blade. It cuts the court.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then I will bleed.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He is burning. Each delay spends him.

Cassandra absorbs the words, steadying her breath.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we spend him with consent, not ignorance.

FADE OUT.

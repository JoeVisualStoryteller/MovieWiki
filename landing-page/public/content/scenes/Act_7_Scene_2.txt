FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The word hangs before anyone says it.

RECALL.

An ADVISOR finally voices it.

                              ADVISOR
                  If he were here—

The Grand Maester raises a hand. Not sharply. Gently.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Finish the sentence.

The advisor swallows.

                              ADVISOR
                  If he were here... the advance would slow.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Yes.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  And then?

Silence.

                              GRAND MAESTER (CONT'D)
                  Then the cost begins to compound.

Cassandra inclines her head. Agreement, not surrender.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

The Necrotic King senses the collapse, smiles.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  There he is.

                              COMMANDER
                  Shall we take him?

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Not yet. Let him bring himself to me.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cassandra waits. Footsteps echo. JOSEPH appears, pale, exhausted.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You're late.

                              JOSEPH
                  I was far.

His eyes flicker; he sways. She reaches for him, then stops herself.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You should have sent word.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I sent word, I would have stopped.

FADE OUT.

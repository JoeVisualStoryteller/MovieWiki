FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra addresses commanders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We march west. We sever the heart. This is the end.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we must move quickly.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  We will not be led blindly.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then keep your eyes open. I will lead regardless.

Plans are laid.

FADE OUT.

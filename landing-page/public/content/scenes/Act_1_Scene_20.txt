FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - PALACE TERRACE - DAWN

The same terrace as before. The city is quieter now, grief held in
its walls. Cassandra stands with the GRAND MAESTER, both looking east.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Holding ground is an illusion.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then so is peace.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Peace was always a delay.

Cassandra watches the sun rise over the mountains, uncertain but
unbroken.

FADE OUT.

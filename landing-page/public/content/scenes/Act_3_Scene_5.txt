FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cassandra approaches Joseph as he stands guard. The hall is empty,
torchlight low.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You could have killed them.

                              JOSEPH
                  I could have. I did not.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Why?

                              JOSEPH
                  Because restraint is the only proof that power
                  is not dominion.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if restraint fails?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then we failed first.

She considers him with new eyes.

FADE OUT.

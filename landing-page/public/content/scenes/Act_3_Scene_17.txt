FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - ROYAL HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cassandra and Joseph stand alone by a window. The city below glows
with lanterns.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If I ask you to stay, the court will fracture.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I stay, they will call it dominion.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if I ask you to leave?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then you will lose the deterrent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if I ask nothing?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then you still choose.

They share the weight of the choice.

FADE OUT.

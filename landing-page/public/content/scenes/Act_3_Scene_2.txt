FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - ROYAL HALL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

JOSEPH (late 20s, quiet, armored in black) stands at attention as
Honor Guard. His presence is calm, unnerving. Eyes follow him, then
look away.

                              KING CONSORT
                  A Death Knight in our hall is a rumor made flesh.

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                  He is a deterrent, not a guest.

Joseph remains still, eyes forward. Cassandra glances once, curiosity
caught and restrained.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN CAPITAL - DAWN

The capital burns. Citizens flee as the dead convert the fallen. A
bell rings until it breaks.

                              REFUGEE
                  The city is gone.

                              SOLDIER
                  Then the north is gone.

Smoke covers the sun.

FADE OUT.

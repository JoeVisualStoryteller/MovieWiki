FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

Cassandra holds Joseph as he fades. The world is silent.

                              JOSEPH
                  Did we hold?

                              CASSANDRA
                  We held.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then it was worth it.

He exhales, still.

FADE OUT.

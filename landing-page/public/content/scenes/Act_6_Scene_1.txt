FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Cassandra scans the map. A single marker, black, sits far to the
north: JOSEPH. She moves it with her finger, then stops.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Where is he now?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  North. Alone.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  He sends no updates.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will read the war without his words.

She looks to the empty space on the map where his marker would be if
he were home.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Do not speak his name in the halls.

The order is quiet, not soft.

FADE OUT.

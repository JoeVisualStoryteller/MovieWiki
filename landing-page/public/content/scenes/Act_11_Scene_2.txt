FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

The court bristles at the coalition.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Foreign blades in Astraea invite influence.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  Influence is cheaper than extinction.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Influence is temporary. Survival must be permanent.

They fall silent, uneasy.

FADE OUT.

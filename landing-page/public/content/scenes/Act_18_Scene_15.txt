FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra declares the final campaign to the court.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Victory is not a moment. It is a finality. We have
                  not earned it yet.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Then you ask us to endure again.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I ask you to live.

The court listens, subdued.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. PALACE CORRIDORS — NIGHT

Orders move cleanly. Trusted guards reassigned. Routes altered.
Messengers redirected. No explanations given. None requested.

CAPTAIN LYS watches his men shift positions.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  You have your orders. You follow them.

A younger guard hesitates.

                              YOUNG GUARD
                  What are we moving for?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  The Queen.

That is answer enough.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

Joseph drops to one knee, almost spent. Cassandra moves forward, but
is held back by guards.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Majesty—

                              CASSANDRA
                  Let me go.

She shakes him off.

FADE OUT.

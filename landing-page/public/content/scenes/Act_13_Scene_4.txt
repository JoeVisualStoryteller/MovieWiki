FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S OUTER CAMP - NIGHT

A sprawling encampment of the dead. Living captives are chained. A
necromancer passes; the captives shudder, eyes going dim.

                              CAPTIVE
                  Please—

A necromancer gestures. The captive's eyes go empty.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN WALL - NIGHT

No delay. The undead climb and breach. The living are overwhelmed.

                              SOLDIER
                  There is no pause!

                              NORTHERN COMMANDER
                  Then we die without one.

A living-turned appears on the wall, eyes empty, still breathing.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

Joseph leads a small strike team to a necromantic nexus. He raises his
hand; the node collapses. He staggers.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  That was too much.

                              JOSEPH
                  It was enough.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  For how long?

                              JOSEPH
                  For this breath.

FADE OUT.

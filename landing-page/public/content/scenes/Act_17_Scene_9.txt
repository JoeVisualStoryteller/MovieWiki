FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

Joseph drops to his knees. Muramasa dims. Cassandra runs to him.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Stay with me.

                              JOSEPH
                  I am already gone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Not yet.

He smiles faintly.

FADE OUT.

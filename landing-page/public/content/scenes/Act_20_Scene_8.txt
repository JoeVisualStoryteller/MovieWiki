FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - COURTYARD - DAY

Reanimation overwhelms the living. Soldiers turn mid-breath. Panic
rises.

                              SOLDIER
                  They're turning us!

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Hold the line!

The line buckles.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Cassandra speaks to the envoy and key commanders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You will know enough to fight. Not enough to fear.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  We accept the terms.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we begin drills at dusk.

An uneasy alliance is forged.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN PROVINCE - RIDGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Joseph stands alone at the ridge, black armor absorbing the light. The
living line holds behind him, anxious.

                              SOLDIER
                  That's the Death Knight.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  He looks like a man.

Joseph raises a hand, whispering in a language that is not a language.
The wind drops. The dead slow, then stop.

                              CAPTAIN LYS (YOUNGER)
                  Hold the line. Do not cross him.

Joseph does not turn. He does not need to.

FADE OUT.

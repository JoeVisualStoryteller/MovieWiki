FADE IN:

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

Joseph speaks to a small circle of captains.

                              JOSEPH
                  The heart is a command node. Cut it, and the dead
                  fall. Miss it, and they rise again.

                              NORTHERN CAPTAIN
                  How do we know we hit it?

                              JOSEPH
                  You'll feel the quiet.

They nod, absorbing.

FADE OUT.

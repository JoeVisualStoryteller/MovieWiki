FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - NIGHT

Cassandra dismounts, steps toward Joseph. The battle roars around
them, but the air between them is still.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You don't have to do this alone.

                              JOSEPH
                  I always have.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Not anymore.

She takes his hand. He doesn't pull away.

FADE OUT.

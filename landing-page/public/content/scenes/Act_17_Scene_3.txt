FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

The Necrotic King staggers, wounded but not yet destroyed.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  You cannot end me with restraint.

                              JOSEPH
                  Watch me.

He steadies his footing, blood at the corner of his mouth.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cassandra approaches Joseph.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The court fears you.

                              JOSEPH
                  They should.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I do not.

He meets her eyes, a moment of charged silence.

                              JOSEPH
                  That is dangerous.

                              CASSANDRA
                  So is everything worth keeping.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - EVACUATION ROAD - DAY

Evacuees are turned back by undead raids. Panic spreads as carts are
forced to reverse.

                              GUARD
                  Roads are compromised. Return to the city.

                              WOMAN
                  We will die there.

                              GUARD
                  You will die here if you run.

The crowd surges, angry and afraid. Cassandra watches from a ridge,
expression locked.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ANCIENT HALL - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

The doctrine is spoken aloud. Each line is a chain.

                              YOUNG MAESTER
                  Power must be restrained.
                  Cost must be personal.
                  Consent matters, even in death.
                  No Death Knight may rule.

                              KNIGHTS
                  We bind ourselves.

Their hands press deeper into stone. The vow seals.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - TRAINING COURT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cassandra practices with a practice blade. Joseph watches, then steps
forward.

                              JOSEPH
                  Your guard is high. Your ribs are open.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Do you always speak in wounds?

                              JOSEPH
                  Only when they can be avoided.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You think I'm careless?

                              JOSEPH
                  I think you are learning to rule with a blade you
                  are not meant to use.

She adjusts. He nods. A small trust begins.

FADE OUT.

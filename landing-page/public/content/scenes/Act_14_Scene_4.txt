FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN BANK - DAY

Living-turned undead charge, faster, stronger. The line buckles.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Brace!

Joseph raises a hand, severing their command. He staggers.

                              SOLDIER
                  He's bleeding.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we hold for him.

FADE OUT.

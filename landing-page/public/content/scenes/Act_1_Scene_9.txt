FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN BORDER - DUSK

A brief clash. ASTRAEAN KNIGHTS drive back a ragged undead vanguard.
The living cheer as the last corpse falls.

INT. FIELD TENT - LATER

GENERAL TESSA receives the report. Sweat and dust on her armor.

                              SCOUT
                  We held the ridge. The line holds.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we call it victory.

The SCOUT hesitates.

                              SCOUT
                  The dead were not moving when we left.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We bury them before night. We do it right.

                              SCOUT
                  The men are exhausted.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Exhaustion is not an excuse. Not tonight.

She looks toward the horizon, uneasy.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. PALACE — PRE-DAWN

Messengers halted. Letters burned unopened. No bells. No banners.

Cassandra watches a flame eat wax, expression locked.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Silence is a weapon.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then it must cut cleanly.

FADE OUT.

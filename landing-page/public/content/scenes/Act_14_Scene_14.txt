FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The living line wavers, horrified. Cassandra stiffens, jaw set.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Hold. Do not break.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  They are turning in front of us.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we refuse to turn with them.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra receives the envoy with full ceremony, minimal warmth.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  The north is broken. We can offer men, ships, and
                  what oaths remain.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Oaths are not enough.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  They are all we have.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then they will carry weight. We will test them.

The envoy bows, accepting.

FADE OUT.

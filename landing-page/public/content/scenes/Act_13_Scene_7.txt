FADE IN:

EXT. ENEMY TERRITORY - NIGHT

Joseph leads a small strike team. He stops them at a ridge.

                              JOSEPH
                  From here, we move as ghosts.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  And if the ghosts see us?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then we die quickly.

They nod, following.

FADE OUT.

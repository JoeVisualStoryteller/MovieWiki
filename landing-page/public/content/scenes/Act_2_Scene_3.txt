FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

Moonlight. A line of corpses lies still. The living wait, tense.

A SOLDIER nudges a corpse with a spear. No movement.

                              SOLDIER
                  They should be standing by now.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  They are not.

                              SOLDIER
                  Is that good?

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  It's unknown. Unknown is dangerous.

They withdraw, eyes scanning the dark.

FADE OUT.

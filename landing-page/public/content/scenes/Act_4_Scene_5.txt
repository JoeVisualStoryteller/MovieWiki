FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - DAY

Cassandra meets her KING CONSORT, ALARIC (40s, dignified).

                              ALARIC
                  The court whispers. They ask if you control the
                  deterrent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The deterrent is not a man to be controlled.

                              ALARIC
                  Then he will control you.

                              CASSANDRA
                  No. He will cost me, and I will choose it.

Alaric studies her, unsettled.

FADE OUT.

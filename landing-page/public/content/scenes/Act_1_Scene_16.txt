FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - SCOUTS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

A SCOUT CAPTAIN presents burned maps. Soot on his fingers.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  We ran the numbers. Even with perfect supply, the
                  rate of conversion outpaces our reinforcements.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Speak plainly.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  It is inevitable if nothing changes.

Cassandra closes her eyes, a long breath.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then something changes.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - LATER

The GRAND MAESTER addresses the council, voice low and measured.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Restraint is not weakness. It is the only thing
                  between us and dominion.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And yet restraint has not won.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  It has kept us alive.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Alive to watch the line fail.

Cassandra watches the exchange, eyes unreadable.

FADE OUT.

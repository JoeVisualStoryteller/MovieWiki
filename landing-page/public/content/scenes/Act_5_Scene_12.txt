FADE IN:

INT. COUNCIL HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A decree seals the history. Wax cools. Names are struck from record.

                              HERALD
                  No mention. No memory. The Order never was.

                              SCRIBE
                  And if it returns?

                              HERALD
                  Then we deny it again.

Ink dries. A truth is buried.

FADE OUT.

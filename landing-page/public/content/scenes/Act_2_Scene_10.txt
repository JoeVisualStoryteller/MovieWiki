FADE IN:

EXT. SOUTHERN PASS - NIGHT

A fresh attack. The undead surge with renewed ferocity. Astraean
soldiers scramble, overwhelmed.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  They're adapting. They're moving where we are thin.

                              SOLDIER
                  We can't hold!

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we die holding.

The living are pushed back as the dead climb over their own fallen.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Cassandra stands, decision set.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We hold the eastern line. We fortify the river
                  crossings and the mountain passes. No retreat
                  without my command.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Understood.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Your restraint will be tested.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then let it be tested where we can see it.

A murmur of approval, fragile but real.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And if the line breaks?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we break it ourselves, on our terms.

The council disperses with urgency.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN FRONT - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

A silent standoff. Joseph raises his hand; a restrained surge of Death
Magic ripples. The undead lines falter but do not break.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  You still hold back.

                              JOSEPH
                  I still choose.

The Necrotic King leans forward, hungry.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Then you will lose.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - NIGHT

Living captives are forced into undeath mid-breath. The line wavers.

                              SOLDIER
                  By the Quiet...

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Do not look away. Do not break.

The living are shaken.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - MORNING

The messenger arrives from the southern pass, breathless.

                              MESSENGER
                  The pass is gone. The dead are moving east.

Cassandra closes her eyes, then opens them.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we draw the final line.

The room goes still.

FADE OUT.

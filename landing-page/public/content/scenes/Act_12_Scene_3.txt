FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - DAY

Engineers fortify the river crossings. Oath sigils shimmer on stone.

                              ENGINEER
                  If they breach here, we have nowhere to go.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we do not let them breach.

He watches the water, understanding the finality of it.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. UNKNOWN — DAWN

The Necrotic King stands amid unmoving dead. A smile, not triumph.
Recognition.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Ah.

(beat)

                              NECROTIC KING (CONT'D)
                  She has chosen.

He lifts a hand. The dead stir.

FADE OUT.

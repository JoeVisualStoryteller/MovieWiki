FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - TRAINING YARD - DAY

Living knights train against weighted dummies. Joseph stands at the
edge, instructing CAPTAIN LYS in low tones.

                              JOSEPH
                  Do not meet the dead head-on. Cut the command.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  With steel?

                              JOSEPH
                  With discipline. Steel is only a tool.

He corrects a stance with a tap of his gauntlet.

FADE OUT.

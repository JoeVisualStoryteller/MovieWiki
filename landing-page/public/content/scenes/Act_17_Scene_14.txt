FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Word arrives. The court is stunned.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  The Necrotic King... gone?

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  At what cost?

They look to Cassandra's empty chair.

FADE OUT.

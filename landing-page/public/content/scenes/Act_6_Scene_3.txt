FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

A fresh batch of undead rises. The ground exhales. The living recoil
as the bodies move.

                              SCOUT
                  Reanimation returned.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The window closed.

                              SOLDIER
                  We burned them.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Fire is not finality.

The line tightens, fear thick in the air.

FADE OUT.

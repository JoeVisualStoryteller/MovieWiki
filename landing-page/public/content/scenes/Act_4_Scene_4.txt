FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cassandra and the GRAND MAESTER stand alone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You know what causes the delay.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  I know what it costs.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Tell me the cost.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  If I say it aloud, the court will hear it.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then speak to me. Not the court.

He hesitates, then nods.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra meets Joseph's eyes.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will not use you as a weapon without your consent.

                              JOSEPH
                  And if I consent, you will still be blamed.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Let them blame me. I will not trade you for silence.

He nods, faint respect in his expression.

FADE OUT.

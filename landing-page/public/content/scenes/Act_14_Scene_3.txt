FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN BANK - DAY

The first wave of Astraeans takes the western bank. Joseph moves ahead,
alone, drawing the undead away.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  He's clearing a path.

                              SOLDIER
                  He's drawing all of them.

They follow, breathless.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

They clash. The sound is a low, resonant hum. The undead stagger, their
threads cut in silence.

                              SOLDIER (O.S.)
                  He is cutting the world.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER (O.S.)
                  Hold the line.

FADE OUT.

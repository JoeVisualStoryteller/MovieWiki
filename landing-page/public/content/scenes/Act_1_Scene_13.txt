FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN CITY TWO - DAY

A battered city. The walls stand, barely. Soldiers raise Astraean
banners over scorched stone.

INT. CITY HALL - DAY

A messenger reads a report to Cassandra via mirror courier. The glass
flickers with static.

                              MESSENGER
                  The second city held for one full day.

                              CASSANDRA
                  One day.

                              MESSENGER
                  The line remains intact. Barely.

Cassandra allows a small breath.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then the line can hold.

Her hand tightens around the frame. A hairline crack forms in the
mirror.

FADE OUT.

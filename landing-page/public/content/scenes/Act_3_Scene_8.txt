FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN PROVINCE - FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The undead command structure collapses. The swarm falters, then
crumbles as if its spine were cut.

The living stare, stunned.

                              SOLDIER
                  We didn't fire a shot.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  We didn't have to.

Joseph lowers his hand. A faint tremor passes through him. He hides
it. Cassandra watches, measuring the cost.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How long can you do this?

                              JOSEPH
                  As long as restraint remains a choice.

FADE OUT.

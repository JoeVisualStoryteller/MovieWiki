FADE IN:

EXT. ANCIENT HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A circle of knights kneel. A young Grand Maester stands before them.
The hall is lit by low fire.

                              YOUNG MAESTER
                  We exist to prevent wars before they begin.

The knights place hands on cold stone.

                              KNIGHT
                  We choose restraint.

Their voices echo, a vow heavy with consequence.

FADE OUT.

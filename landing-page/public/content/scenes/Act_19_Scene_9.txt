FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - NIGHT

Back home, the court debates the cost. ALARIC watches, worried.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  If she fails, there will be no throne.

                              ALARIC
                  Then we pray she does not.

A courtier looks away, unconvinced.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - DAWN

The undead press the far bank. The living brace. Joseph stands apart,
a silent threat.

                              SOLDIER
                  He looks small.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  He looks like a final answer.

Joseph closes his eyes, listening to the dead.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - RIDGE - DAY

A recon team views the heart's pulsing glow through broken walls.

                              SCOUT
                  It's alive.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then we cut it.

                              SCOUT
                  If it fights back?

                              JOSEPH
                  It will. We must not flinch.

FADE OUT.

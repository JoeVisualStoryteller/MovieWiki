FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - DAY

The advance stalls. Astraean soldiers watch in disbelief.

                              SOLDIER
                  The line holds.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  It holds because someone is bleeding for it.

He looks north, worried.

FADE OUT.

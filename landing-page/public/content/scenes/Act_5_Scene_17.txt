FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

The GRAND MAESTER meets Cassandra's eyes.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  I failed him. I failed all of them.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will not fail again.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  That is a vow you may not survive.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then it is worth making.

FADE OUT.

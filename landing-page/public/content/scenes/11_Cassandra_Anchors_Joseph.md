## SCENE — The Anchor
INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR – NIGHT

Cassandra senses the shift in the castle. Torches flicker. Stone groans.

She finds Joseph braced against the wall, death magic receding.

She approaches slowly.

CASSANDRA
You came back.

JOSEPH
Barely.

She places her hand over his heart. His breathing steadies.

CASSANDRA
You’re not alone anymore.

The pressure collapses inward. Restraint reasserts.

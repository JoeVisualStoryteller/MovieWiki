FADE IN:

EXT. ORDER KEEP - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Paladins storm the keep. Death Knights refuse escalation. They fall
without unleashing the full force they carry.

                              DEATH KNIGHT
                  We will not become dominion.

Flames rise. The keep burns on purpose.

FADE OUT.

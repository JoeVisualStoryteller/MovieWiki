FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - DAY

The Necrotic King's commanders appear. Living-turned lead the advance,
fast and strong.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Fresh ones. Stronger.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then we cut deeper.

He steps forward, hand raised.

FADE OUT.

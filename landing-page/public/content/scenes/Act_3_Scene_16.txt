FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The GRAND MAESTER speaks softly to Cassandra, away from the others.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The optics of his presence will break the court.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then the court is brittle.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  It is also our shield.

                              CASSANDRA
                  A shield that demands a sacrifice.

He nods, regretful.

FADE OUT.

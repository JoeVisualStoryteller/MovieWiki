                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The strike was discovered. The Necrotic King knows.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we have his attention.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Attention is not victory.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It's the door. We will force it open.

FADE OUT.

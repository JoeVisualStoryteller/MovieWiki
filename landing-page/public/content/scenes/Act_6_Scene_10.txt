FADE IN:

EXT. SUPPLY ROUTE - DAY

Undead raiders cut a convoy. Oxen fall, carts burn. Supplies scatter
into mud.

                              GUARD
                  They know our routes.

                              GUARD TWO
                  They are the routes now.

A living-turned pulls a wheel off a cart with unnatural strength.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra announces a new doctrine to her commanders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The living will fight the undead without becoming
                  them. We will cut command, protect the Quiet, and
                  hold the line together.

Murmurs. Some nod. Some resist.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  That doctrine was buried with the Order.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we dig it up.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

A report arrives: the Necrotic King is aware. His forces shift.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Their hunt has sharpened.

Cassandra looks at Joseph, then at the map.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we are running out of time.

                              JOSEPH
                  Time was never ours.

The room absorbs the weight.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - OUTER GATE - DAY

A small delegation arrives under white banners. A NORTHERN ENVOY steps
forward, dust-covered, formal.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  We come to speak for those who remain.

Guards look to Cassandra on the battlement. She nods, the gates open.

FADE OUT.

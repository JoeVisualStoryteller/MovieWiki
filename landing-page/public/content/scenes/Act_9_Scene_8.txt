FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - CONTINUOUS

Joseph looks away.

                              JOSEPH
                  I am not yours to command.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I did not command. I asked you to live.

                              JOSEPH
                  The line does not live without me.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we teach it to.

A beat. He hears the shift.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - SAME

A GENERAL stands, tension cracking through his composure.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  With respect, Your Majesty—
                  if he exists to prevent this, then—

                              CASSANDRA
                  —then I am entitled to spend him?

The general stops.

Cassandra steps forward, voice steady.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  If restraint lasts only until it becomes
                  inconvenient, then it was never restraint.

The general lowers his eyes.

FADE OUT.

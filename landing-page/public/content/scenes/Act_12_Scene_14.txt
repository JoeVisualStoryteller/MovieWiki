FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - NIGHT

Joseph uses Death Magic in short, controlled bursts. Each use drains
him visibly.

                              JOSEPH
                  Hold.

The undead retreat. Joseph sways.

                              SOLDIER
                  He's shaking.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we hold for him.

FADE OUT.

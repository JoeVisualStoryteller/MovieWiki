FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - RIDGE - MORNING

A final private moment amid the noise. Cassandra touches his cheek.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Return to me if you can.

                              JOSEPH
                  I will return in the only way I can.

They part.

FADE OUT.

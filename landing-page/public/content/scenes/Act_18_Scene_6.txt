FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

The court is restless.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  The Necrotic King is defeated. The coalition should
                  leave.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  If the dead still move, it is not defeat.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  And if the queen prolongs war to keep control?

A dangerous whisper. Cassandra is not there to answer.

FADE OUT.

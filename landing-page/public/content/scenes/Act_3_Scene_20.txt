FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cassandra stares at the map, a vacancy where Joseph stood.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We removed the deterrent.

She closes the door, decision hardening.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Now we live with it.

FADE OUT.

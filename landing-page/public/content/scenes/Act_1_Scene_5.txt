FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN OUTPOST CITY - DAY

Smoke rises from cracked walls. The bell tolls too slowly. The city is
scarred, the gates hanging.

INT. OUTPOST CITY - COMMAND HALL - CONTINUOUS

A MESSENGER stumbles in, covered in ash. A CAPTAIN grips the table,
waiting for the words that will break him.

                              MESSENGER
                  The gates failed. The southern quarter fell first.

                              CAPTAIN
                  How long did they hold?

                              MESSENGER
                  Two hours. Then the dead stood up again.

A smaller officer flinches.

                              OFFICER
                  We burned them.

                              MESSENGER
                  We burned the bodies. The command still called them.

The CAPTAIN closes his eyes, then opens them with cold resolve.

                              CAPTAIN
                  Send the report. Now.

The messenger nods, already turning.

FADE OUT.

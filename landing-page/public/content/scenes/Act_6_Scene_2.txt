FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - DAY

The undead advance resumes, methodical. A village burns. The living
flee with what they can carry.

                              SOLDIER
                  The delay is gone.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then the war is honest again.

A child stumbles; a soldier lifts him onto a cart.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  Where is the deterrent?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Far. And not enough.

The dead keep coming, patient and certain.

FADE OUT.

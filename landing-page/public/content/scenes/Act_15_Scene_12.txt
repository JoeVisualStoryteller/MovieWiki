FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - NIGHT

Cassandra sees the cost on Joseph. She makes a decision.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Fall back to the ridge. Now.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We lose ground.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We gain time.

The living withdraw, forming a tighter ring.

FADE OUT.

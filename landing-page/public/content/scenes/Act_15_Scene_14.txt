FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

The GRAND MAESTER arrives, breathless.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The line will not hold without you.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then it will not hold.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It will hold long enough.

They look at each other, aligned.

FADE OUT.

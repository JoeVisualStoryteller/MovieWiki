FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN FRONT — NIGHT

Joseph stands alone on a ridgeline, studying a map that no longer
aligns. The line is too quiet. The enemy is too still.

                              JOSEPH
                  Something is wrong.

A SCOUT approaches, hesitant.

                              SCOUT
                  Orders from the Queen, sir.

Joseph takes the sealed letter, does not open it yet.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

The NORTHERN ENVOY demands clarity.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  We bled for a promise. Is it finished?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Not yet.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  And if our people refuse another march?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then they refuse their own future.

The envoy considers the cost.

FADE OUT.

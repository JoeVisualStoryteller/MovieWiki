FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - NIGHT

The GRAND MAESTER speaks quietly.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The more the living learn, the more dominion will
                  adapt. Escalation cuts both ways.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we make restraint contagious.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  That is not a doctrine. It is a war.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we fight it with clarity.

FADE OUT.

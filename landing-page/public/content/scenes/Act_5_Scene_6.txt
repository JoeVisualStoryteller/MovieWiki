FADE IN:

EXT. COUNCIL STEPS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A crowd gathers. Accusations fly. Torches move like angry stars.

                              CROWD
                  They are monsters! They decide who lives!

                              GUARD
                  Stand back!

A Death Knight watches from the steps, expression unreadable.

                              CROWD (CONT'D)
                  Restraint is a leash! Cut it!

The Order is framed as a threat.

FADE OUT.

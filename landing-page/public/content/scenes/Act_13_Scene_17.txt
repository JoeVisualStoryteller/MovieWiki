FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Cassandra sits alone, the weight immense. ALARIC enters.

                              ALARIC
                  You are choosing him.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I am choosing Astraea.

                              ALARIC
                  And yourself?

                              CASSANDRA
                  That choice was taken when I was crowned.

He does not argue.

FADE OUT.

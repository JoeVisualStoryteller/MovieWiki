FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - SUPPLY HALL - NIGHT

VADA delivers bad news. Her hands shake with fatigue.

                              VADA
                  The routes are compromised. We have weeks.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then weeks is what we have.

                              VADA
                  The court will demand exemptions.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The court will endure like everyone else.

Vada nods, relief mixed with fear.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PALADIN CHAPEL - DAY

A PALADIN COMMANDER arrives with a small order. Oath sigils glow faintly.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  We will fight. But not under a Death Knight.

                              CASSANDRA
                  He does not command you.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then say it publicly.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Publicly is not always wise.

The commander bristles.

FADE OUT.

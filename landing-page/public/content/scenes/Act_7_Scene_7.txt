FADE IN:

INT. THRONE HALL — EVENING

Witnesses wait. Courtiers rehearse relief. Cassandra does not sit.

                              CASSANDRA
                  There will be no public recall.

Shock ripples.

                              ADVISOR
                  Your Majesty—

                              CASSANDRA
                  —would turn him into a symbol.

(beat)

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Symbols invite worship or revolt.
                  Neither survives restraint.

Silence follows.

FADE OUT.

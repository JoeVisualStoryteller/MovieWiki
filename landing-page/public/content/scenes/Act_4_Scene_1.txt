FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Present day. Cassandra convenes the council. The mood is tense, the
room packed with maps and pinned losses.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We meet again without comfort. Speak.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The line holds, but it is thin. The south bleeds.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The western silence remains absolute.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Silence is not peace. It is a warning.

Cassandra looks at the Rift on the map.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we listen to the warning and act.

FADE OUT.

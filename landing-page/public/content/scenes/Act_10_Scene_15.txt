FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - TRAINING YARD - NIGHT

Joseph works with a small unit under torchlight. He corrects stances,
shows where to strike command nodes.

                              JOSEPH
                  Do not fight the tide. Break the current.

                              SOLDIER
                  What if the current is us?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then you step aside. You choose not to be a weapon.

They repeat the drill, quieter now.

FADE OUT.

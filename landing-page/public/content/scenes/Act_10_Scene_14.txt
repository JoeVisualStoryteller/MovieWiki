FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - CITY SQUARE - DAY

Cassandra addresses the people without naming Joseph. Her voice
carries over the stone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We endure by restraint. We endure by each other.

                              CROWD
                  Long live Astraea.

The chant is subdued but real.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER — LATE NIGHT

An advisor speaks softly, as if the walls might listen.

                              ADVISOR
                  When this becomes known—

                              CASSANDRA
                  —it will be called betrayal.

The advisor nods.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Let it fracture.

(beat)

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  A broken council can argue.
                  A broken world cannot.

Silence settles like ash.

FADE OUT.

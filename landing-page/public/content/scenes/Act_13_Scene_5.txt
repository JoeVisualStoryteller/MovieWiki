FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

The court confronts Cassandra.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  The realm bleeds while you gamble on a secret.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The realm bleeds because the secret was killed.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  You speak of the Order.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I speak of restraint. And I will not bury it again.

The room goes still.

FADE OUT.

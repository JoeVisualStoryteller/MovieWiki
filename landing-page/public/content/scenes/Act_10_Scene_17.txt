FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

The Necrotic King watches the retreat.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  They learn.

                              COMMANDER
                  Shall we break them?

                              NECROTIC KING
                  We will teach them fear.

His smile is thin and cruel.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - SUPPLY HALL - MORNING

The QUARTERMASTER, VADA, speaks to Cassandra, numbers in hand.

                              VADA
                  The southern pass needs reinforcements. The north
                  needs food. We can meet one.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we shift pressure. We don't break.

                              VADA
                  The court will complain.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Let them. Feed soldiers before courtiers.

Vada nods, relieved and worried at once.

FADE OUT.

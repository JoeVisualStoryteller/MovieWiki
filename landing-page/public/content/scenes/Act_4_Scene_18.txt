FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Cassandra addresses the council. Her voice does not waver.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Joseph will be recalled. Quietly.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Publicly.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I said quietly.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The people must see the deterrent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The people must survive. That is all they need.

Her tone ends the debate.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT

A rescue unit arrives. Joseph turns, eyes cold.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Orders from the Queen. You come home.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I leave, they surge.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  If you stay, you die.

                              JOSEPH
                  That was always true.

He hesitates, the smallest crack.

FADE OUT.

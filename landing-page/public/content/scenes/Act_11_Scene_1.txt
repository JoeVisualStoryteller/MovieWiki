FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - MORNING

Coalition banners flutter beside Astraean standards. Columns move with
measured discipline.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The line breathes again.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  For as long as your doctrine holds.

Cassandra watches from a ridge, the cost in her eyes.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - PALACE TERRACE - DAWN

Joseph stands beside Cassandra, unseen by others. The city wakes.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Survival is all we promise.

                              JOSEPH
                  And we keep it, for now.

They look east, a shared silence between them.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

Joseph's summoned undead join the living line. They fight with
discipline, speech, and clarity.

                              SUMMONED WARRIOR
                  For restraint.

                              SOLDIER
                  They speak.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  They chose to be here. So did we.

The line steadies.

FADE OUT.

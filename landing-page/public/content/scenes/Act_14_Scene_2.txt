FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - CONTINUOUS

The crossing is chaos. Arrows, undead, Oath Magic flares. Paladins
hold a narrow gap.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Hold the span!

                              SOLDIER
                  They're on the bridge!

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then throw them off.

The living hold.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN FRONT - DAY

Joseph surveys a shattered command post. Black ash covers the ground.
The wind carries whispers he does not answer.

                              JOSEPH
                  One more.

A SCOUT approaches, hesitant.

                              SCOUT
                  Sir, the Queen's recall—

                              JOSEPH
                  Hold it. I will move when the line can breathe.

He turns back to the ruins, reading the enemy's absence like a wound.

FADE OUT.

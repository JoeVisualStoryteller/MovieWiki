FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Joseph uses a measured surge of Death Magic to seal the skirmish. He
winces, steadying himself.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Save yourself.

                              JOSEPH
                  I'm saving us.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  We can carry the weight.

                              JOSEPH
                  Not yet.

FADE OUT.

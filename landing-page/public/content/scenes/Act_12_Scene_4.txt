FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

The court demands visibility.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Show the Death Knight, or the court will move
                  without you.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then let the court move. I will hold the line.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  That is a fracture you may not recover.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I am not here to recover. I am here to endure.

The room chills.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. CASSANDRA'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

Only Cassandra and the Grand Maester. The door is closed. The air is
thin.

                              CASSANDRA
                  What does he know?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Enough to obey.
                  Enough to endure.

                              CASSANDRA
                  What doesn't he know?

The Grand Maester hesitates.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  How close he is to the edge.

Cassandra turns away.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If I tell him—

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  —he will escalate to spare you the burden of choice.

Cassandra closes her eyes, accepting the weight.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - DAY

The battle begins. Oath Magic flares. Living knights break command
nodes. The undead falter, then surge.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Hold!

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Seal the gap!

The line shakes.

FADE OUT.

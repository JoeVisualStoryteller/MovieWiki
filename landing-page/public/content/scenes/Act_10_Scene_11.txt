FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

A survivor reports, shaking.

                              SURVIVOR
                  He turned them while they screamed. They were still
                  breathing.

Cassandra clenches her jaw.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we end this before it becomes policy.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We need a plan that doesn't spend him alone.

Cassandra nods.

FADE OUT.

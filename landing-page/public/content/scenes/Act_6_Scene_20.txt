FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAWN

The final report of the morning arrives. Cassandra takes it herself.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The East is open. There is no outer line now.

Cassandra stands, alone in the room. She looks at the map as if it
might speak.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then Astraea is the line.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - NIGHT

Joseph returns, bleeding. The GRAND MAESTER tends him.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  You cannot keep doing this.

                              JOSEPH
                  I can. Once more.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  There is no "once" left.

Joseph closes his eyes, knowing.

FADE OUT.

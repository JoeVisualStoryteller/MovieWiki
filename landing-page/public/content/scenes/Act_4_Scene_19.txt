FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra refuses a public announcement. The court presses.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  You turn him into a rumor. Rumors breed fear.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Symbols breed worship or revolt. Neither is
                  restraint.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  Then you choose silence.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I choose survival.

The court falls into uneasy quiet.

FADE OUT.

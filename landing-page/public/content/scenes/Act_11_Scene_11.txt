FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Joseph and Cassandra confer.

                              JOSEPH
                  If they expose me, it destabilizes you.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If I expose you, it kills you.

A beat.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then we hold the line anyway.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We hold it together.

He nods, accepting the shift.

FADE OUT.

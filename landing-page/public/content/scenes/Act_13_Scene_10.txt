FADE IN:

EXT. ENEMY TERRITORY - DAWN

The strike team is detected. Undead riders descend.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  We are blown!

Joseph raises a hand, covering their retreat.

                              JOSEPH
                  Go!

He stands alone against the rush.

FADE OUT.

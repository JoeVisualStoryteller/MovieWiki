FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

The court votes to expose Joseph. Cassandra intervenes.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Any who break restraint will be tried for treason.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  You would try the court?

                              CASSANDRA
                  I would try anyone who breaks the world.

She draws a line they did not expect.

FADE OUT.

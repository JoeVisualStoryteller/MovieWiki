FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAWN

The chamber is quieter than it has ever been. No arguments. No
overlapping voices. Only parchment unrolling and the soft scrape of
pins removed from maps that no longer require pretending.

Cassandra stands at the head of the table. She does not sit. The Great
Rift is still visible on the map, but it has lost its authority.

A GENERAL clears his throat.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We are out of time.

No one challenges him.

Cassandra studies the map not as a queen, but as someone who
understands distances and rates of loss.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We were always out of time.

(beat)

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  We just ran out of places to hide it.

FADE OUT.

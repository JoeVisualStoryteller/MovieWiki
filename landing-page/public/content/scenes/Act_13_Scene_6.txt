INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - NIGHT

ALARIC speaks privately with Cassandra.

                              ALARIC
                  They speak of removing you.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then they speak too soon.

                              ALARIC
                  If they do, the crown fractures.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The crown will hold. It is what I do.

He sees the steel in her.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN PROVINCE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An alarm bell echoes across a border town. Smoke rises beyond the
fields. Villagers run. Soldiers form a line with too few spears.

Cassandra rides in with a small escort, cloak snapping in the wind.

                              CAPTAIN LYS (YOUNGER)
                  Majesty, the western ridge is breached. The dead are
                  coming in waves.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How long until they reach the town?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  An hour. Less, if they don't stop to feed.

Cassandra looks at the frightened faces lining the walls.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we don't let them reach the town.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  We need a deterrent.

Cassandra hesitates, the word heavy in her mouth. She nods once.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Call him.

FADE OUT.

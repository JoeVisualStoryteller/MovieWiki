FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Reports stack. The GRAND MAESTER reads aloud.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The delay spread to the northern ridge. It skipped
                  the river pass entirely.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Uneven. Unpredictable.

Cassandra taps the map, then the dates.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Not unpredictable. We just don't see it yet.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  Or we do not want to see it.

Cassandra ignores the jab.

FADE OUT.

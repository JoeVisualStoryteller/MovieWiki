FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN PLAINS - DAY

The coalition advances into open ground. The undead flank, steering
them toward a narrow valley.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  They are herding us.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we don't run.

Cassandra scans the terrain, reading the trap.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

A COURIER stumbles in, white-faced.

                              COURIER
                  The southern region is gone. The line collapsed
                  overnight.

A map marker falls from Cassandra's hand.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Overnight?

                              COURIER
                  We slept. They did not.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  How many?

                              COURIER
                  All who were left.

The room is stunned into silence.

FADE OUT.

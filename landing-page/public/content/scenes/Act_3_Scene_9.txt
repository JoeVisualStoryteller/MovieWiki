FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The KING and QUEEN acknowledge Joseph's service before the court.
Banners hang still. The air is formal, uneasy.

                              KING
                  Astraea owes a debt we can never repay.

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                  We honor it with restraint.

Joseph bows once, neither humble nor proud.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then do not try. Just hold the line.

A ripple of discomfort in the court. They do not applaud.

FADE OUT.

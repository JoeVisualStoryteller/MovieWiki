FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra looks to the window, then back.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If the Order died because of fear, we will not
                  govern by fear.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The court is built on fear.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then I will rebuild it.

FADE OUT.

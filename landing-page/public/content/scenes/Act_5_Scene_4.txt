FADE IN:

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A Death Knight stands between two armies. Wind flattens banners. The
escalation collapses in silence.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                  Wars were prevented. Kings were deterred.

The living retreat, spared and furious at being spared.

FADE OUT.

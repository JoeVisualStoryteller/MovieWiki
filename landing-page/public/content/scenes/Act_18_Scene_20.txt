FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN ROAD - DAY

Cassandra rides at the head of the column. Joseph rides behind, pale
but upright. Their eyes meet across the ranks.

                              CASSANDRA
                  This is the end.

                              JOSEPH
                  The end we choose.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. CASSANDRA'S STUDY — NIGHT

A smaller map. A truer one. Candlelight trembles on ink.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  A quiet recall requires omissions.

                              CASSANDRA
                  From whom?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Everyone.

(beat)

                              GRAND MAESTER (CONT'D)
                  Including him.

Cassandra considers.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How long before he notices?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He already has.

FADE OUT.

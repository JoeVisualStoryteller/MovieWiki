FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONTIER - NIGHT

The undead wave crests into the eastern hemisphere. A new incursion.

                              SCOUT
                  The East opens.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Then the world is here.

A chill passes through the line.

FADE OUT.

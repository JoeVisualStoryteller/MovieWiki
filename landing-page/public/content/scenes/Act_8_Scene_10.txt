FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

The Necrotic King watches a map as the delay falters.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  The window is open.

                              COMMANDER
                  Shall we strike the source?

                              NECROTIC KING
                  We are already striking. Now we harvest.

He lifts a hand. The hunt shifts.

FADE OUT.

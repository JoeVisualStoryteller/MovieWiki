FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN RIVER CROSSING - DAY

The undead seize a crossing. The Astraean banner falls into the river
and drifts away.

                              SOLDIER
                  We're isolated.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we fight like we're already cut off.

The river carries the banner out of sight.

FADE OUT.

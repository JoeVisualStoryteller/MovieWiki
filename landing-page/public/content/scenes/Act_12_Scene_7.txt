FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Cassandra and Joseph share a rare quiet.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If you go, you will not return.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I stay, you will not survive.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we both die choosing.

They stand close, restrained by everything around them.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Fresh scout reports arrive. Cassandra flips through them.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The delays continue in the north. The south burns.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we are being tested, not attacked.

She looks to the GRAND MAESTER, who avoids her gaze.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  You know something.

He says nothing.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - MORNING

Cassandra sits before a stack of fresh reports. The SCOUT CAPTAIN
stands, breathless.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The advance stalled. Two full days without movement.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The dead do not pause for weather.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  They paused anyway.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  A trap?

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  We found no bait. No ambush. Just stillness.

Cassandra taps the map, unsettled.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we find the cause. Or we admit we are blind.

FADE OUT.

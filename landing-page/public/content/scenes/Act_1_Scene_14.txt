FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN CITY TWO - NIGHT

A breach. The dead pour in. The living fight street to street.

A fallen CAPTAIN gasps, eyes fixed. He dies. His eyes open again.

The defenders falter as their dead rise among them.

                              SOLDIER
                  They're ours... they're ours!

                              SERGEANT
                  Not anymore!

A living-turned swings on his own line. Panic spreads. The line breaks.

FADE OUT.

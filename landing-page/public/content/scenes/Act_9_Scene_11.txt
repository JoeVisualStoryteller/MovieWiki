FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

A formal document is placed between Cassandra and Joseph. The ink is
clean, the seal heavy.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Consent must be formalized.

                              JOSEPH
                  I do not sign for war.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You sign for choice.

Joseph hesitates, then signs.

FADE OUT.

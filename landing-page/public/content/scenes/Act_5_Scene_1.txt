FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra and the GRAND MAESTER sit alone. The war room is far away.
A confession begins.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The Order was born from failure.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Whose failure?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Everyone who mistook restraint for weakness.

He draws a breath, as if dusted with centuries.

                              GRAND MAESTER (CONT'D)
                  I will tell you, and then you will never sleep the
                  same.

Cassandra nods.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - CITY GATE - DAY

Civilians load carts under guard. A MOTHER clasps her child's hand.

                              GUARD
                  Move. Keep moving.

Cassandra watches the evacuation from a distance. She sees a man hand
his cloak to a shivering elder.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How many moved today?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Two hundred. We turned back another hundred. The
                  roads are thin.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then the roads become a weapon. Protect them.

She turns away before the people can see her hesitate.

FADE OUT.

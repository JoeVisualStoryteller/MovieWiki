FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

The NORTHERN ENVOY demands clarity.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  We will not bleed for a secret.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then bleed for survival. That is the only truth
                  worth sharing.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  If your secret fails, my people fall.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If my secret is exposed, mine fall. We share the
                  same risk. That is alliance.

The envoy hesitates, then nods.

FADE OUT.

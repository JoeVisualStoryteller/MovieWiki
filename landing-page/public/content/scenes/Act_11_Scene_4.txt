FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PALADIN CHAPEL - DAY

Paladins argue among themselves.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  We will not take orders from a Death Knight.

                              PALADIN LIEUTENANT
                  We can take doctrine without taking his hand.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  That doctrine was buried for a reason.

                              PALADIN LIEUTENANT
                  So were we, if we fail.

The commander hesitates, pride at war with necessity.

FADE OUT.

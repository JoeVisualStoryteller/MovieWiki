FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - LATER

Joseph traces the delay corridor on the map with a gloved finger. The
council watches him as if he might break it by touching it.

                              JOSEPH
                  I sever command nodes. They grow new ones.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  How many can you cut?

                              JOSEPH
                  Enough to delay. Not enough to end.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The delay becomes a beacon. They hunt the source.

Cassandra looks between them, realizing the danger.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then each delay costs more than time.

Joseph meets her eyes, a silent confirmation.

FADE OUT.

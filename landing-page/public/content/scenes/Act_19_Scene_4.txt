FADE IN:

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

A SCOUT arrives, mud-covered.

                              SCOUT
                  The heart is inside the old citadel. There are two
                  viable approaches.

Cassandra studies the map.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And one is a corridor of death.

The scout nods.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - DAY

ALARIC pleads with Cassandra.

                              ALARIC
                  You are alone against them.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I was born to be.

                              ALARIC
                  That is not a blessing.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It is the crown.

He reaches for her hand. She does not take it.

FADE OUT.

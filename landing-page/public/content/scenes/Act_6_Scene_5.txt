FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - MORNING

Reports confirm old patterns. Cassandra slams a marker down.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The old war has returned.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  With the old pace.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  And the old cost.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we stop pretending we can outrun it.

She steadies herself, eyes on the map.

FADE OUT.

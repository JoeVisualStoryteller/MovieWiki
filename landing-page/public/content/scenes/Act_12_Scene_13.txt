INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra receives updates from the Rift.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  The line holds. Barely.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Barely is still holding.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  And if it doesn't?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we die buying time for the living.

She grips the table.

FADE OUT.

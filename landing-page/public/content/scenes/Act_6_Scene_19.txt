FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN HILLS - NIGHT

Joseph is absent. A dark horizon, no sign of him. The dead advance
unchallenged.

A lone SCOUT watches, uneasy.

                              SCOUT
                  If he were here—

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  He is not. Hold anyway.

They dig in as the wave approaches.

FADE OUT.

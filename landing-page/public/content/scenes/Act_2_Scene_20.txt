FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAWN

Cassandra and the GRAND MAESTER stand over the map. The delay markers
form a corridor.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It can be done. The advance can be stopped.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  At a cost.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Tell me the cost.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Not yet.

She nods, choosing ignorance for now.

FADE OUT.

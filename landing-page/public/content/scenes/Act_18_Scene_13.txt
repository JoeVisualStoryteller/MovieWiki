FADE IN:

INT. PALADIN CHAPEL - NIGHT

Cassandra meets the PALADIN COMMANDER.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will not ask you to serve dominion. Only restraint.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then we will stand with you.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if he returns?

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then we stand against him together.

A pact is sealed.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra studies the new pattern, lines crossing the map.

                              CASSANDRA
                  This is dominion doctrine. Not conquest. Control.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He has learned from the Order.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  And he learned without restraint.

Cassandra hates that truth.

FADE OUT.

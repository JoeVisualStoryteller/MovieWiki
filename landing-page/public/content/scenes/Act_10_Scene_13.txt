FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

The court resists.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  This is fantasy. The Death Knight is the only
                  deterrent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we make deterrence a discipline, not a man.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  And if the discipline fails?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we fail together, not behind his back.

The council falls silent.

FADE OUT.

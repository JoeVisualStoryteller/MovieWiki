FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL ANTECHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Two COUNSELORS argue in hushed tones. Cassandra approaches, listens
for a beat.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  The treaty with the northern provinces is thin.
                  They will not bleed for us.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  And the southern ships are late. We have no surplus.

Cassandra steps in. The argument dies.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If our treaties are fragile, then speak as if they
                  are glass. No threats. No promises we cannot keep.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Without force, they will drift.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we anchor them with truth.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  What truth do we give them?

                              CASSANDRA
                  That Astraea will not collapse quietly. If they want
                  to survive the tide, they stand with us.

She passes, leaving them chastened and uneasy.

FADE OUT.

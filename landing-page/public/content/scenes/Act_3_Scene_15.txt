FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Advisors argue about marriage politics. The air is transactional.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  The northern alliance demands a royal match.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  We cannot offer a queen to war.

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                  We can offer a sister. We can offer a cousin.

Cassandra stands still, aware of the trap.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I am not a treaty.

A hush. The court pretends not to hear.

FADE OUT.

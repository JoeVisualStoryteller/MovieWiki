FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

Cassandra reaches Joseph, kneels beside him.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You are not alone.

                              JOSEPH
                  I am at the end.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then let me stand there with you.

Their eyes meet.

FADE OUT.

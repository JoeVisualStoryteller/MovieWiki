FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN FRONT - NIGHT

Joseph moves independently through enemy lines, a shadow. He reaches
an unseen necromantic nexus and raises his hand.

A silent ripple. The nexus collapses. The undead shudder, direction
lost.

                              JOSEPH
                  Enough.

His shoulders sag for a breath, then he moves on.

FADE OUT.

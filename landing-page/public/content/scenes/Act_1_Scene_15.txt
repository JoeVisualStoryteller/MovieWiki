FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Markers collapse across the map like a chain reaction. A SERIES OF
PINS falls as a runner calls out names.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  One city falls, the next has no time to resupply.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The failures are linked. It's a chain-collapse.

Cassandra leans over the map, eyes narrowing.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then our line is not a line. It is a fuse.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  And fuses burn.

No one speaks after that.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. HIGHLAND RIDGE - DUSK

A SCOUT peers through a spyglass. A lone BLACK-ARMORED FIGURE moves
among the dead, quiet as a shadow.

                              SCOUT
                  By the Quiet...

The figure turns slightly, then vanishes into mist.

                              SCOUT (CONT'D)
                  It can't be.

He lowers the glass, hands shaking.

FADE OUT.

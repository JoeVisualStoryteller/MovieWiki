FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra reads the scout's report. The GRAND MAESTER watches.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Seal this. No copies. No gossip.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  If the court learns—

                              CASSANDRA
                  They will panic. We cannot afford panic.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  And if they learn too late?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then they learn survival the hard way.

He nods and places the report in a locked coffer.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ENEMY TERRITORY - CONTINUOUS

Joseph holds the riders back, face strained. The team escapes.

                              JOSEPH
                  Go.

                              CAPTAIN LYS (O.S.)
                  Come with us!

                              JOSEPH
                  I am.

He staggers after them, barely.

FADE OUT.

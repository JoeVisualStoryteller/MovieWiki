FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL OUTSKIRTS - DAY

The citadel rises, black against the sky. The coalition halts at its
edge.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  This is it.

                              CASSANDRA
                  This is the heart.

She surveys the fortress.

FADE OUT.

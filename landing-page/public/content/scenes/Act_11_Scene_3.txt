FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - TRAINING YARD - DAY

Joseph instructs coalition captains, curt and precise.

                              JOSEPH
                  Cut the command. Do not chase the tide.

                              NORTHERN CAPTAIN
                  And if the command is hidden?

                              JOSEPH
                  Then you are already losing. You learn to see it.

They absorb the lesson, sweating.

FADE OUT.

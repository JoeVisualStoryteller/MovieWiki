FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra stands, pacing. The confession reframes the war.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The past reframes the present. We are not defending
                  a line. We are correcting a crime.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Correction has a cost.

                              CASSANDRA
                  So did the crime.

FADE OUT.

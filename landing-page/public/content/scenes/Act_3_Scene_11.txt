FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN FRONT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

The NECROTIC KING appears for the first time. The air cools. The living
shrink back. His armor is old, his posture regal and wrong.

Joseph steps forward, calm.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Finally. A man worth killing.

                              JOSEPH
                  Killing is a choice. You no longer have one.

The Necrotic King smiles, amused.

FADE OUT.

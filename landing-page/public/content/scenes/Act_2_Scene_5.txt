FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Cassandra looks between the scout reports, the anomaly marked in
charcoal.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Verify everything. Twice. I want eyes on the ground
                  in every sector.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  That will thin the line.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we thin it. Send them.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  If this is a deterrent, it has a cost.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will learn the cost.

Tessa nods, reluctant but obedient.

FADE OUT.

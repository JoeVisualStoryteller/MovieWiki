FADE IN:

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

Cassandra walks alone. Joseph joins her.

                              JOSEPH
                  If you ask, I will say yes.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will ask when it matters.

                              JOSEPH
                  It already does.

They stand in silence.

FADE OUT.

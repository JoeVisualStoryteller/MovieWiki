FADE IN:

EXT. EXTRACTION CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The corridor collapses. Undead surge in. The escort fights, panicked.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Hold the line!

Joseph raises a hand, barely. A brief stillness, then the dead press
again.

                              SOLDIER
                  He's slipping!

FADE OUT.

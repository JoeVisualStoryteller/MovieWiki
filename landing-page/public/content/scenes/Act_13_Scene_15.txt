FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - NIGHT

The undead test the line. The living hold, barely, as Joseph remains
absent.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We cannot hold without him.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we must.

A paladin steps forward, chant rising.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NORTHERN NATION - DAY

Undead banners crest the hills. The northern city panics. Citizens run
as guards scramble to close the gates.

                              NORTHERN COMMANDER
                  We are not ready.

                              SOLDIER
                  We are never ready.

The dead arrive like a slow tide.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra addresses the court, measured.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We speak of fortifications and supply.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And the deterrent?

                              CASSANDRA
                  The deterrent is restraint. That is all you need.

Her eyes warn against curiosity.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN ROAD - NIGHT

Campfires flicker. The coalition eats in silence. The weight of the
end presses on them.

                              NORTHERN CAPTAIN
                  If we fail here, we are nothing.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we do not fail.

                              SOLDIER
                  If we succeed?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we live long enough to argue about it.

FADE OUT.

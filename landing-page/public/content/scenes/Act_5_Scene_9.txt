FADE IN:

INT. PALADIN CHAPEL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

PALADINS kneel, armed. Oath sigils glow.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  We are sent to end the order.

                              PALADIN
                  They saved us.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  And in doing so, they became a crown of terror.

They rise, grim.

FADE OUT.

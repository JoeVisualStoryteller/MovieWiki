FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - DAY

Joseph enters the valley alone. The undead turn toward him, drawn like
metal to a magnet.

                              SOLDIER
                  He's calling them.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  He's taking them off us.

Joseph raises a hand, stilling them.

FADE OUT.

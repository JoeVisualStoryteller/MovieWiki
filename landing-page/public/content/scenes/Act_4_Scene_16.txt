FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Pressure builds. Reports of breaches arrive from the north.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The delay no longer holds.

                              JOSEPH
                  It holds where I stand.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And where you do not?

Joseph does not answer. His silence is the answer.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Then the line is one man.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we must stop pretending it isn't.

FADE OUT.

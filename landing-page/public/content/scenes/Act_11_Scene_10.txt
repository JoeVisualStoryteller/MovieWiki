FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - ROYAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

ALARIC warns Cassandra.

                              ALARIC
                  They plan to force your hand. The court does not
                  trust what it cannot see.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then they will learn to trust restraint.

                              ALARIC
                  They may not survive the lesson.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Neither will I if I fail.

He watches her, concerned.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN ROAD - DAY

The coalition marches through ruined towns. Ash covers the ground. A
rusted bell hangs sideways in a church tower.

                              SOLDIER
                  This used to be a city.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  It will be a city again if we finish this.

No one is sure.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - NIGHT

Joseph lies on a stone slab, pale, veins darkened. The GRAND MAESTER
moves with ancient precision, placing bowls, drawing salt lines.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  You stayed too long.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I leave, they die.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  If you stay, so do you.

Joseph closes his eyes, breath shallow.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then I will die delayed.

The Grand Maester's hands pause, grief flickering.

FADE OUT.

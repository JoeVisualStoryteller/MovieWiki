FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The court buzzes with fear. Rumors sharpen into demands.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  A Death Knight on our soil invites disaster.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He is the reason disaster has not come.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  Or the reason it will.

Cassandra watches the room fracture, her eyes on the floor, not the
faces.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra stands alone, staring at a small blade on her desk. The room
is quiet except for the scratch of wind on stone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Is our doctrine true, or only familiar?

She turns to a shelf of old war texts, pulls one free.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  If it is wrong, how many will we bury to learn it?

No answer comes.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra addresses the coalition commanders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We fall back to the Rift. We hold with everything.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  And if we fail?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we fail together.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then we fight to prevent the word "fail" from
                  being spoken.

FADE OUT.

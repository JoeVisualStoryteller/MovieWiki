FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - LATER

The room feels smaller now. Pressurized.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  A recall is not retrieval.
                  It is permission.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Permission for what?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  For him to stop holding the line alone.

(beat)

                              GRAND MAESTER (CONT'D)
                  For the world to notice again.

A ripple of unease moves through the chamber.

                              ADVISOR
                  Can he survive it?

The Grand Maester waits before answering.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Survival is the wrong metric.

Cassandra's jaw tightens.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then give me the right one.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Duration.

FADE OUT.

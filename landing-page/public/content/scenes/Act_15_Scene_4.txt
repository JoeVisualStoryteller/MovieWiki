FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - NIGHT

The living hold the choke. Paladins chant, Oath Magic flaring.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Hold! Hold!

                              SOLDIER
                  They're breaking!

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we don't.

The undead push, but the line holds.

FADE OUT.

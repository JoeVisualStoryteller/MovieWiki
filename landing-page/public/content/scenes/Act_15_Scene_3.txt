FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - NIGHT

Joseph gathers himself, steadied by her presence.

                              JOSEPH
                  If I fall, do not hesitate.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will not.

                              JOSEPH
                  That is not comfort.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It is truth.

Their honesty is brutal and intimate.

FADE OUT.

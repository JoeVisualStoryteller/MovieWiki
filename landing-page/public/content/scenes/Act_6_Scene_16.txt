FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - SUPPLY HALL - NIGHT

Cassandra orders rationing. Guards and clerks look up, tense.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Ration all stores. No exemptions.

                              VADA
                  The court will revolt.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we feed the people first.

                              VADA
                  And the guard?

                              CASSANDRA
                  The guard eats with the people. No one is above the
                  line anymore.

Vada nods, empowered and afraid.

FADE OUT.

## SCENE — Princess Meets Joseph
INT. PALACE CORRIDOR – DAY

Princess Cassandra walks with attendants. They stop before a lone knight.

JOSEPH kneels. He does not look at her until she speaks.

CASSANDRA
You may rise.

He does. He studies the room, not her.

CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
You don’t fear me.

JOSEPH
No, Your Highness.

CASSANDRA
Why?

JOSEPH
You’re paying attention.

She smiles. Recognition sparks.

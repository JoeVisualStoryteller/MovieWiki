FADE IN:

INT. ROYAL COURT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Nobles whisper. Fear takes new shape.

                              NOBLE 1
                  They make war unaffordable.

                              NOBLE 2
                  They make us irrelevant.

                              NOBLE 3
                  If they choose, they can end us.

The room chills at the truth they speak.

FADE OUT.

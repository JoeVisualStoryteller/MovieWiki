FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - CONTINUOUS

A tense standoff. The living hold their breath.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  You could end this. Join me.

                              JOSEPH
                  I refuse dominion.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Then you refuse mercy.

The undead growl, ready.

FADE OUT.

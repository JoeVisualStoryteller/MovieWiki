FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - DAY

Scouts pick through a field of fallen undead. No traps. No fires. No
sign of battle. The air is too quiet.

                              SCOUT
                  They just... stopped.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Find a cause. A trail. Anything.

A scout pries open a frozen eye. It is empty.

                              SCOUT
                  No command thread.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Then who cut it?

They spread out, searching for logic in a silent field.

FADE OUT.

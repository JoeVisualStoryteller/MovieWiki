FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - OUTER GATE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Joseph leaves in silence. A small escort watches. The city keeps its
breath.

Cassandra stands at the battlement above, unseen.

                              CASSANDRA
                  This is not dismissal. This is survival.

Joseph does not look back. He understands anyway.

FADE OUT.

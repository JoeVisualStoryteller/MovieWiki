FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - AFTERNOON

Maps are weighted with stones. Multiple routes marked in charcoal and
red wax.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Fortify the river line. Pull back the frontier.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  If we retreat, we concede cities without a fight.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The line must be where restraint is strongest.

Cassandra listens, fingers on the Rift.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If we withdraw, we inherit panic.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  If we do not, we inherit the dead.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  There is no choice without cost.

Cassandra looks at each of them.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we choose the cost we can pay.

FADE OUT.

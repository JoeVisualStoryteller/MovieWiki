FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

The Necrotic King senses the intrusion.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  He comes for me.

                              COMMANDER
                  Shall we retreat to the heart?

                              NECROTIC KING
                  No. Let him taste the trap.

He smiles.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - OUTER ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A minor threat: bandits ambush a royal caravan. Joseph moves with
speed, disarming without killing. The bandits flee, terrified.

Cassandra watches, impressed by the restraint.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You could have ended them.

                              JOSEPH
                  Endings must be chosen, not indulged.

She watches him differently after that.

FADE OUT.

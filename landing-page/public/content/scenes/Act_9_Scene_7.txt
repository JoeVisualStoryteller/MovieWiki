INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - CONTINUOUS

Cassandra steps closer.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You disobeyed the recall.

                              JOSEPH
                  I held the line.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And you broke yourself.

                              JOSEPH
                  That was always the bargain.

She shakes her head, refusing that bargain.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The KING and QUEEN MOTHER speak in low tones. Cassandra listens from
the doorway.

                              KING
                  The court will demand he leave.

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                  And if he does, we invite the dead.

                              KING
                  Then we keep him, quietly.

Cassandra steps in.

                              CASSANDRA
                  He saved the province. He is not a guest.

                              QUEEN MOTHER
                  He is a deterrent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will deter with him until we can stand
                  without him.

The King looks at her, proud and wary.

FADE OUT.

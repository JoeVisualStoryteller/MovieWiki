INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - MORNING

Cassandra convenes the commanders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We do not have time for another delay. We must
                  strike the head.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The Necrotic King does not expose himself.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we make him.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  That is a sentence written in blood.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then let it be written by us.

FADE OUT.

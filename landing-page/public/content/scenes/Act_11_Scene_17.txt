FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - NIGHT

An ambush. Undead riders descend on Joseph's team. He holds them back
long enough for the living to escape.

                              JOSEPH
                  Go!

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  You're bleeding!

                              JOSEPH
                  Then run faster.

He stumbles into the dark as they escape.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. CONVERSION CENTER - NIGHT

A grim structure. Joseph enters. A wave of cold passes through. The
living captives collapse, released. The undead fall.

                              CAPTIVE
                  We thought we were dead.

                              JOSEPH
                  You are not. Do not waste it.

He moves on, already fading.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. BLACK RELIQUARY - NIGHT (SEALED)

Cold stone. No banners. Vows carved in the walls. Grand Maester waits in shadow as silent witness.

Cassandra and Joseph face each other, helmet off, armor scraped. Muramasa’s scabbard rests between them like a line not to cross without consent.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Say my name.

                              JOSEPH
                  Cassandra.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Not Majesty. Not Queen. Just me. Do you choose this?

                              JOSEPH
                  I choose you. Freely. Once. Always.

He offers his gauntlet. She removes it, takes his bare hand. The air thickens; his eyes dim instead of glow—calming, not summoning.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Witnessed. By choice, not dominion.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I bind you as consort in truth, never as crown. You may leave if I ever make you a weapon.

                              JOSEPH
                  I bind myself to you, not to courts. If I fall, it is by my consent, not their command.

They lower their joined hands to Muramasa’s scabbard—a vow of restraint, not conquest.

                              BOTH
                  Cost is personal. Consent remains.

A beat. No rings. No crowns. Only breath shared, steadier now.

                              CASSANDRA
                        (whisper)
                  No heralds. No hymns.

                              JOSEPH
                  No need. We know.

FADE OUT.

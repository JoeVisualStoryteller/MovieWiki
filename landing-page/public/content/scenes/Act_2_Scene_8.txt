FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - LATER

Cassandra stands alone at the map. She moves markers herself,
tracing the anomalies. Her fingers linger on a narrow corridor.

She takes a piece of charcoal and draws a line.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You are not random.

The line is thin, deliberate.

FADE OUT.

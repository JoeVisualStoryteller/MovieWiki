FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

A councilor demands numbers. The air is sharp.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  How many lives does restraint cost? Give us numbers.

                              CASSANDRA
                  The numbers are not yours to spend.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Then the court will spend them for you.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The court cannot purchase restraint. It can only
                  break it.

Cassandra holds the line.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will not break.

FADE OUT.

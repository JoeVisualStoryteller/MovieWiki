FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Unease grows. The council whispers as Cassandra enters.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The death in his wake is visible.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And the court will demand visibility.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  We cannot keep a rumor on the throne.

Cassandra sits, calm on the surface.

                              CASSANDRA
                  You will demand what you want. You will receive what
                  you need.

The room quiets. No one likes it, but no one argues.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - LATER

A smaller council. Cassandra at the head, weary. The room smells of
ink and smoke.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  We do not need to win. We need to hold.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  If we hold long enough, the western remnants may
                  regroup.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Holding is not victory. It is delay.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Delay is not nothing.

Cassandra looks at the map, then at her council.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then delay becomes our success.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And if delay fails?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we accept what we refused to name.

They sit with that, silent.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

The Necrotic King studies the defeat, then smiles.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  If they learn, I teach them fear.

He turns to a chained LIVING SOLDIER, eyes wide.

                              NECROTIC KING (CONT'D)
                  Begin the lesson.

FADE OUT.

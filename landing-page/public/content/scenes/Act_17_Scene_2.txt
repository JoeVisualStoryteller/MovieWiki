FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

The undead collapse in waves. Living-turned fall, freed into finality.

                              SOLDIER
                  The dead... they're falling.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  They're quiet.

The line breathes for the first time in days.

FADE OUT.

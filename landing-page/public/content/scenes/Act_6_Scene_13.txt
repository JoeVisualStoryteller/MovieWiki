FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

Cassandra looks at the encirclement, the line collapsing inward.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  This is a phase change. They are no longer pressing
                  the line. They are enclosing it.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  Then Astraea becomes a cage.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Or a fortress.

Her voice is the only thing holding the room together.

FADE OUT.

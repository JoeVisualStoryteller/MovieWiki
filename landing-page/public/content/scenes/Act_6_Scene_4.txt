FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN CITY - NIGHT

A city collapses under a surge. Gates splinter. The dead pour in.
Living-turned sprint past defenders, too fast to stop.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Fall back! Fall back!

                              SOLDIER
                  They're inside!

A bell tolls once, then is silenced by a scream.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Whispers of a coalition spread.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The northern remnants speak of alliance. Quietly.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Quietly is not enough to save us.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Quietly is the only way it arrives.

She keeps the order intact.

FADE OUT.

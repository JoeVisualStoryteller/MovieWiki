FADE IN:

EXT. RIVER CROSSING - NIGHT

A living unit holds without Joseph. Paladins use Oath Magic to seal a
breach. The undead falter, retreat.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  It worked!

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  It held. That is not the same thing.

The victory is costly but real.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NARROW VALLEY - DAY

The undead surge. The living are pressed hard. Oath Magic flares but
flickers.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  We cannot hold this long.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Then we shorten the long.

Cassandra watches the line bend.

FADE OUT.

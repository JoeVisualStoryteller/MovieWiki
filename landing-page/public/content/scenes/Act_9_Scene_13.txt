FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - DAY

The enemy adapts. Reports show new command nodes.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  He is learning. The delay will not last.

                              JOSEPH
                  I will not last.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we do not build a war on one life.

A plan begins to form.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - COURTYARD - DAY

The Necrotic King is wounded, his form breaking. He screams, the sound
like metal tearing.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  You will join me.

                              JOSEPH
                  I already have.

FADE OUT.

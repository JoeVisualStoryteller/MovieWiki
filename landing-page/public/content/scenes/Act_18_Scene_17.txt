FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Undead stir without command, drawn toward the pulsing heart. The
living-turned shudder, unstable.

                              SOLDIER
                  They are moving again.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Then we march faster.

FADE OUT.

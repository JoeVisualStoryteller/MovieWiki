FADE IN:

INT. COMMAND TENT - NIGHT

The GRAND MAESTER speaks with Cassandra.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He is burning from the inside. There will not be a
                  return.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then I will make the return unnecessary.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  That is not mercy.

                              CASSANDRA
                  It is survival.

FADE OUT.

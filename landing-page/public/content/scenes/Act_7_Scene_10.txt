FADE IN:

INT. CASSANDRA'S STUDY — NIGHT

Cassandra signs. Once. Twice. Each seal carries more weight. The wax
cools like a verdict.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Once sealed, this cannot be undone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I know.

She seals it anyway.

FADE OUT.

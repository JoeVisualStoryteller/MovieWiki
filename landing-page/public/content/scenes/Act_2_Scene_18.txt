FADE IN:

INT. NECROTIC KING'S WAR HALL - NIGHT

A vast chamber of black stone. The NECROTIC KING stands over a map of
bone. A COMMANDER kneels.

                              COMMANDER
                  The eastern advance hesitates. Command nodes vanish.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  Something cuts my spine.

                              COMMANDER
                  A Death Knight?

                              NECROTIC KING
                  There is only one left who could.

He lifts a skeletal hand. The bones tremble.

                              NECROTIC KING (CONT'D)
                  Find the blade.

FADE OUT.

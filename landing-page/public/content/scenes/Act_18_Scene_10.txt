FADE IN:

INT. HEALING TENT - DAY

Cassandra sits by Joseph. She takes his hand.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will ask you. I will not command.

His fingers twitch faintly.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  If you choose no, I will still go.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

Cassandra waits outside the sealed door. The GRAND MAESTER steps out,
hands stained with ash and blood.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Will he live?

The GRAND MAESTER hesitates, then speaks.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  My Queen, Death Knights dance with death so that
                  others may love.

Cassandra swallows, the words cutting deep.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And what of those who love them?

The Grand Maester has no answer he can give.

FADE OUT.

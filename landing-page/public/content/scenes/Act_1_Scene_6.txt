FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - REFUGEE LINE - DAY

Refugees enter under guard. Cloth bundles, ash-streaked faces. A boy
stares at the walls as if they might move.

Cassandra walks the line with a MEDIC. Her cloak hides her crown.

                              MEDIC
                  They say the dead learned to climb.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Fear teaches rumors.

A REFUGEE WOMAN steps forward, eyes steady.

                              REFUGEE WOMAN
                  No, Majesty. It taught us to leave.

Cassandra stops. The woman meets her eyes without flinching.

                              REFUGEE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  They did not need ladders.

                              CASSANDRA
                  What did you see?

                              REFUGEE WOMAN
                  The ground opened. The dead stood. The living still
                  breathed, and then they didn't.

The boy clutches his mother's sleeve.

                              BOY
                  Are we safe here?

Cassandra kneels to his level.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Safer than where you were. We will keep it that way.

She stands, eyes hardening as she moves on.

FADE OUT.

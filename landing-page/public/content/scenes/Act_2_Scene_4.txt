FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN OUTPOST RUINS - DAWN

A burned command post. No signs of siege. No bodies. Just ash.

A SCOUT kneels, touching the ground.

                              SCOUT
                  The command structure is gone. Erased.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Without a battle.

                              SCOUT
                  Who does that?

The captain looks toward the horizon.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  Someone who doesn't want to be found.

FADE OUT.

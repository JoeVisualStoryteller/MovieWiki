FADE IN:

EXT. GREAT RIFT RIVER - DAWN

The line holds through the night. Bodies line the riverbank.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We held.

                              JOSEPH
                  For now.

He looks across the river, knowing what's coming.

FADE OUT.

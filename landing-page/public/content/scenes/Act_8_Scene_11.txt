FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

A scout reports Joseph's failure to move.

                              SCOUT CAPTAIN
                  He hasn't withdrawn. He's holding alone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  He will die.

A terrible clarity settles. No one speaks.

FADE OUT.

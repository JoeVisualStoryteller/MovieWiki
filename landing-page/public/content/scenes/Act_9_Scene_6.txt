FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - NIGHT

Joseph opens his eyes. Cassandra stands at a distance, cloak thrown
back. The air tightens.

                              JOSEPH
                  You should not be here.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then I should not be queen.

A flicker in his gaze.

FADE OUT.

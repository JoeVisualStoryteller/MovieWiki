FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - HEALING CRYPT - DAY

Joseph prepares to return to the front. The GRAND MAESTER stops him.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The cost will end you.

                              JOSEPH
                  It has always ended me.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Then why return?

                              JOSEPH
                  Because the world asked me to, and I said yes.

He steps past, resolved.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

Cassandra meets with advisors. She remains composed, but distant.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  He is hidden. The court notices.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Let them notice. They will not see.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  They will demand visibility.

                              CASSANDRA
                  They will receive survival.

She stands, ending the discussion.

FADE OUT.

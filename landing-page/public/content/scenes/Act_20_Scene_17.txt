FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - COURTYARD - DAY

The undead destabilize. They crumble, collapsing into stillness.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  They're falling!

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Keep the ring!

The line steadies.

FADE OUT.

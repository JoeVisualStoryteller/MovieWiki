FADE IN:

EXT. RUINED CHAPEL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The Necrotic King, once a Death Knight, stands alone in the ruins. His
restraint fractures.

                              NECROTIC KING
                  If they fear restraint, they will learn dominion.

He turns into the darkness, choice made.

FADE OUT.

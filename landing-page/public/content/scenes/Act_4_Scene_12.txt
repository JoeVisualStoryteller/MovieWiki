FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE STUDY - NIGHT

Cassandra and the GRAND MAESTER speak in low tones. A single lamp
throws long shadows.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If the court learns, they will demand his chain.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Then do not let them learn.

                              CASSANDRA
                  That is not rule. It is concealment.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  It is survival. The crown survives by choosing what
                  it can reveal.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if the truth demands to be seen?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  Then it will be seen at the worst possible time.

Cassandra turns away, jaw tight.

FADE OUT.

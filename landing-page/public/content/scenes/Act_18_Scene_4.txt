FADE IN:

INT. HEALING TENT - DAY

Joseph lies still. The GRAND MAESTER checks his pulse and holds his
wrist longer than a breath.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  He has not crossed.

                              MEDIC
                  Is that possible?

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  With restraint. With cost.

The words are fragile hope.

FADE OUT.

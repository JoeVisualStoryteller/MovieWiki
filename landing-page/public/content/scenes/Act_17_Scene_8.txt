FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE VALLEY - NIGHT

The undead destabilize. Without command, they crumble. The battlefield
falls quiet.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  It's over.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Don't say it yet.

No one celebrates.

FADE OUT.

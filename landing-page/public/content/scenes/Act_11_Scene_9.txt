FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

A secret gathering of councilors.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  The court must see the Death Knight. If she hides
                  him, we reveal him.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  And if the Queen refuses?

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Then the court refuses her.

Their eyes glint with the edge of coup.

FADE OUT.

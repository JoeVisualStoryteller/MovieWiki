FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN FRONT - DAY

A strange quiet. The undead lines are still. The living hesitate,
waiting for the next surge.

                              SOLDIER
                  They stopped.

                              SOLDIER TWO
                  They always stop before they strike.

Time passes. They do not strike. The living look to each other.

                              SOLDIER
                  Is it over?

                              CAPTAIN LYS (O.S.)
                  It's never over. Hold.

FADE OUT.

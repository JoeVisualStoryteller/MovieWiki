FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - LATER

A STRATEGIST unrolls a scroll: a ledger of losses, dates marked like
wounds.

                              STRATEGIST
                  The Undead Empire does not win battles. It wins
                  calendars. It is attrition, not conquest.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Every siege becomes a conversion. Every loss becomes
                  their gain.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  It is a war of endurance. That is why we survive.

Cassandra studies the ledger, then the map.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Endurance is not a plan. It is a threshold.

                              STRATEGIST
                  Then what do we call it?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Delay. Until we find a way to make delay a weapon.

The room settles into a grim focus.

FADE OUT.

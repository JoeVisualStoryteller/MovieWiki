INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

Cassandra faces the council.

                              CASSANDRA
                  No mention of the delay. No mention of the figure.
                  We speak only of fortifications and supplies.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  We are lying.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We are preserving order.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  Order built on silence breaks harder.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will catch the pieces before they fall.

The council falls silent.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Joseph touches her hand, then withdraws.

                              JOSEPH
                  There is no forgiveness in this.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I did not ask for it.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then what do you ask?

                              CASSANDRA
                  That you stay until the world can stand without you.

He holds her gaze, the cost visible.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - MEMORIAL GARDEN - DAY

A quiet ceremony. No public grandeur. Cassandra places a simple stone.

                              CASSANDRA
                  He kept us alive.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  And he asked for nothing.

She steps back, alone.

FADE OUT.

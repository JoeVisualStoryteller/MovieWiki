FADE IN:

EXT. EASTERN BORDER - NIGHT

Moonlight bleaches the battlefield. Wind whistles through helmets.

A SOLDIER drives a shovel into the earth. The ground shudders.

A fallen defender's eyes snap open. Another. Then dozens.

The living freeze as their own dead stand.

                              SOLDIER
                  No... we burned them.

                              SERGEANT
                  Get behind the line!

The reanimated defenders turn, weapons in hand, and advance.

                              SERGEANT (CONT'D)
                  It's not them. It's not them.

The line breaks in a single, terrified moment.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. NECROTIC SUPPLY LINE - NIGHT

Joseph strikes a supply convoy of undead. Carts shatter. The line
breaks. The undead pause, leaderless.

                              JOSEPH
                  Halt.

He spares the living prisoners, cutting their chains with a glance.

                              PRISONER
                  Who are you?

                              JOSEPH
                  Go.

FADE OUT.

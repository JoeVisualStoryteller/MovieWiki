FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - DAY

A councilor steps forward, careful.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  And the Death Knight?

                              CASSANDRA
                  He chose restraint. He chose finality.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  And we choose to remember?

                              CASSANDRA
                  We choose to endure.

Her voice does not break.

FADE OUT.

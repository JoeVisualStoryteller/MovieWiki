FADE IN:

INT. HEALING TENT - NIGHT

Joseph opens his eyes, weak but awake. Cassandra is there.

                              JOSEPH
                  Still here?

                              CASSANDRA
                  We are not done.

                              JOSEPH
                  And you need me.

                              CASSANDRA
                  I will not command you.

                              JOSEPH
                  Then I will choose.

He nods, understanding the cost.

FADE OUT.

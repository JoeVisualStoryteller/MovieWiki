FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - PALACE TERRACE - DAWN

A cold sun crawls over the mountains. Wind off the sea hits stone. The
city below is fortified and awake, a lattice of walls, watchtowers,
and smoke.

QUEEN CASSANDRA (early 30s, composed, iron in her eyes) stands in a
plain cloak over ceremonial armor. No jewels. No indulgence. Only
weight.

She watches the eastern gates open. A line of wounded and refugees
shuffles in. A bell tolls once, then stops. This is not a ceremony.

A HORN sounds. Distant, then closer. A procession approaches.

Cassandra watches without flinching.

INT. ASTRAEA - THRONE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The throne hall is austere: banners, columns, no gold. The court is
assembled in rigid rows. A silence falls as Cassandra enters and takes
the throne.

CAPTAIN LYS (40s, hardened) kneels, dirt in the seams of his armor.

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Your Majesty. The line held, but only just.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How many returned?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Half the standard. Fewer from the southern ridge.

Cassandra nods once, absorbing the loss.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And the civilians?

                              CAPTAIN LYS
                  Evacuated before the breach. The farms are gone.
                  The granaries burned.

A COUNCILOR shifts, nervous.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  The western reports arrived at nightfall. The last
                  holdfast has fallen.

A murmur threatens. Cassandra raises a hand. The room stills.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we are the line.

She steps down from the dais and walks between her people. Soldiers
straighten, eyes on her.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  We will not trade restraint for panic.
                  We will not trade our people for time.

She pauses by a YOUNG SOLDIER, blood dried on his cheek, eyes too old.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Astraea does not break. Not today.

The room straightens. They breathe with her.

                              CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                  Convene the war council. Now.

She turns, cloak sweeping, and the court follows.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. WESTERN CITADEL - CONTINUOUS

Coalition banners align beside Astraean standards. Paladins, northern
remnants, and living knights move as one.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  Together.

                              NORTHERN ENVOY
                  Until the end.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - MORNING

Cassandra meets her advisors. Her expression is hard.

                              CASSANDRA
                  If the doctrine fails, what then?

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Doctrine does not fail, Majesty. People fail.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  We can hold if we commit fully.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The doctrine is not a wall. It is a warning.

                              CASSANDRA
                  A warning for whom?

Silence. Cassandra sees the evasions.

FADE OUT.

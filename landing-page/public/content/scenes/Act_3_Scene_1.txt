FADE IN:

EXT. ASTRAEA - ROYAL COURTYARD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Young PRINCESS CASSANDRA (late teens) walks through the courtyard with
her attendants. The kingdom is at peace, but watchful. Guards bow as
she passes.

                              ATTENDANT
                  The northern envoy waits.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then we will not keep them waiting.

She keeps her pace even, her face already a mask of rule.

FADE OUT.

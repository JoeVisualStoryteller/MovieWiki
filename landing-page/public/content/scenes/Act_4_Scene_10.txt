FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

The council watches Joseph enter. A cold silence.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  So the ghost returns.

                              JOSEPH
                  The delay has limits.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The dead are adapting.

                              JOSEPH
                  So must we.

The room shifts, uneasy at his presence.

FADE OUT.

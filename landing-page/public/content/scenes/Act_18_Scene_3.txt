FADE IN:

INT. PALADIN FIELD CHAPEL - DAY

Paladins argue in low tones.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  The necromancy persists. The rite did not end it.

                              PALADIN LIEUTENANT
                  Because the source still beats.

                              PALADIN COMMANDER
                  Then our oath isn't done.

They share a grim look.

FADE OUT.

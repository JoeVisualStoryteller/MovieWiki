FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - SUPPLY HALL - DAY

Tables of ledgers. QUARTERMASTER VADA speaks fast, counting shortages
on her fingers.

                              VADA
                  We are burning stores at triple rate.

                              COUNCILOR SAHEL
                  From fortifications?

                              VADA
                  From reburial. From evacuation. From holding ground
                  we cannot hold.

Cassandra enters mid-sentence. The room stills.

                              CASSANDRA
                  How long with current consumption?

                              VADA
                  Three months. Four if we ration hard.

                              CASSANDRA
                  And if the line breaks?

                              VADA
                  Then two. Then none.

Cassandra nods, expression unreadable.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Begin rationing. Quietly. We do not starve in panic.

Vada swallows, then nods.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - WAR COUNCIL CHAMBER - MORNING

A stone map table carved with the Great Rift. Pins bleed red into the
western half. Reports are stacked, bound in wax.

The council stands as Cassandra enters. The GRAND MAESTER (ancient,
severe) is already there, hands clasped.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The western hemisphere is lost.

A collective exhale. Cassandra does not sit.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Confirmed by whom.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  By all remaining outposts. No replies in two weeks.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  The last holdfast fell at dusk. Survivors crossed
                  the Rift at dawn.

Cassandra looks at the river carved in stone. The line is real, but
thin.

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then the war is no longer distant.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  It was never distant. It was delayed.

Silence. Cassandra sets a finger on the eastern bank.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We will proceed as if the world can still be saved.
                  Until it cannot.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  And if the line fails?

                              CASSANDRA
                  Then Astraea becomes the world.

They absorb the weight. Cassandra turns to the map.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. ASTRAEA - COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Advisors gather, skeptical.

                              COUNCILOR VEL
                  Two anomalies do not make a pattern.

                              COUNCILOR RAIM
                  If it is a trick, we cannot afford to chase it.

                              GENERAL TESSA
                  If it is help, we cannot afford to ignore it.

                              GRAND MAESTER
                  The world survives on partial truth. We should not
                  add to it.

Cassandra remains silent, weighing the room.

                              CASSANDRA
                  We will see it for ourselves.

FADE OUT.

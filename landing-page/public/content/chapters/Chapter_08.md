## Chapter 8 — The Price of the Choice

### First Sight

Astraean scouts saw the Necrotic King’s host crest the eastern hills at dawn—rows of bone and stolen breath, standards black and fraying. They ran the alarm through the city like a torn banner. Cassandra climbed to the battlements and saw the tide herself.

“Form to meet them,” she ordered. “We will not wait to be swallowed.”

### Failed Sortie

The living rode out—Paladin champion at the fore, King Consort beside him, a thin line of knights and conscripts. They met the dead on open ground. Oath-light flared. Steel rang. At first, the Paladin’s charge cut a channel; archers loosed into the gap; infantry pushed to hold it. Then the dead absorbed the blow and folded around their flank. A captain vanished under a tide of hands. An archer line ran out of shafts and went to blades. Living-turned shock troops hit the rear—eyes still wet, breath still steaming. Signals garbled. Oath Magic bought seconds, not finality. Shouted orders dissolved into “Fall back!” and “We’re surrounded!” It lasted an hour before it collapsed.

Living-turned rose mid-battle, eyes still blinking, mouths still shaping prayers. Lines broke. The sortie became a retreat. They dragged the living back, left the dead where they fell, and watched them stand again as the living staggered through the gates.

“Hold the walls,” Cassandra said, voice raw. “We do not bleed twice for the same ground.”

*Hold ground and we die twice. Yield ground and the dead pour in. “Holding” is a foreign word when the enemy rises faster than breath.*

### Regroup and Doubt

In the yard, armor clattered off shaking bodies. A captain dropped his helm and retched. The Paladin champion spat blood and doctrine. “We are not meant to fight beside death,” he said, jaw clenched. “Recall him and we damn ourselves.”

“We damn ourselves if we don’t,” Cassandra replied. “Choose the damnation you can live through.”

King Consort Aelius tried for calm. “We fortify. We conserve. We wait.”

“We have been waiting for years,” Cassandra said. “Waiting is what bled us.”

Quartermasters arrived with ledgers, eyes hollow. “Grain at half,” one said. “Arrows at a third. Water stores holding—for now.”

“Ration again,” Cassandra ordered. “Keep the men on the walls fed before the salons.”

The Paladin champion sneered. “This is not how kings rule.”

“Then leave,” Cassandra said. “Or stand, but do not preach starvation to me.”

His blade had carved through dozens in the sortie. It had not been enough. Even his Oath-light dimmed when the third wave rose. He looked away.

### What He Shielded Them From

At midmorning, the Necrotic King made a demonstration. A fresh battalion of Astraean conscripts, caught on the field during the failed sortie, were dragged forward—alive, screaming, still breathing. Cassandra and the Paladin champion watched from the wall as the Necrotic King lifted one hand.

They did not die. They were seized. Bones cracked, skin grayed, eyes emptied while lungs still drew air. Armor hung on bodies that went limp, then straightened under an alien will. An entire battalion turned undead while hearts still beat.

The Paladin champion’s face drained of blood. “This is…” His voice failed.

*This is what Joseph stood against alone,* Cassandra thought, stomach lurching. *He held this back from our walls.* Horror crawled up her throat—revulsion at the sight, guilt for every day she let him carry it unseen, love sharpened to a knife because he had chosen to be the only wall between this and her people. Her hands shook on the stone; she forced them still. *He ate this for us. He bled this for years. And I sent him away to do it in shadow.* He had to do it alone; only he could. If the council had seen this, they would have chained him—weapon, slave, property. Solitude was the only way he kept restraint from being turned into dominion by their fear.

### Signals and Preparations

She ordered signals rigged along the parapets—flare arrows to mark breaches, bells to call shifts. Civilians were moved into inner courtyards; children watched the walls with wide eyes and chewed on fear instead of bread.

Grand Maester joined her at the map table set up on the battlements. “If he comes, it will be when the line thins,” he said.

“Then we thin where it costs us least,” Cassandra answered. “And pray he reads the signs.”

### Relentless Waves

They came in waves. The first broke against the wall. The second climbed on the first. The third arrived while the dead from the first still twitched. Living-turned pressed their faces to the stone, eyes empty, still breathing—victims of the Necrotic King’s live seizure, his perverted Death Magic none had survived copying. The Paladin champion’s blade glowed; his lips bled from prayer. Cassandra cut a glance to the Grand Maester, a queen’s nod that was both plea and order: authorize anything that kept the living from bearing war alone.

*Wave after wave. Every fall is a debt. Every rise a bill I cannot pay. Joseph, how long have you carried this tide alone?*

Losses mounted. A captain fell and stood again before her eyes. A banner bearer was dragged off the parapet by hands that had been Astraean yesterday. Cassandra did not let her gaze drop. She could not afford to.

### Astraea Under Siege

The Necrotic King pressed on the capital with a patience that felt like cruelty. The walls shook under constant assault. The dead did not tire, did not sleep, did not negotiate. Every hour the line thinned; every night the city grew quieter.

Cassandra stood on the battlements with the King Consort, the Paladin champion, and the remaining knights who had not been eaten, turned, or crushed. A queen, a consort, a priest, and a handful of steel between a city and an army of bone.

“We hold until the last breath,” she said. “We do not kneel.”

The drums of the dead answered. Every heartbeat sounded like a countdown.

### Relentlessness

They came in waves. The first broke against the wall. The second climbed on the first. The third arrived while the dead from the first still twitched. Living-turned pressed their faces to the stone, eyes empty, still breathing—victims of the Necrotic King’s live seizure, his perverted Death Magic none had survived copying. The Paladin champion’s blade glowed; his lips bled from prayer. Cassandra cut a glance to the Grand Maester, a queen’s nod that was both plea and order: authorize anything that kept the living from bearing war alone.

Losses mounted. A captain fell and stood again before her eyes. A banner bearer was dragged off the parapet by hands that had been Astraean yesterday. Cassandra did not let her gaze drop. She could not afford to.

“This is it,” a soldier whispered. “We are dead.”

It was not a complaint. It was a fact accepted.

### The Encirclement

Then the air changed. The pressure on the walls did not ease—something else shifted. Shapes formed on the field behind the living line: ranks of undead assembling with discipline, shields locking, archers raising bows. The living recoiled.

“Necrotic reinforcements!” someone screamed.

A soldier dropped his spear and begged. The Paladin champion lifted his blade, torn between smiting and praying.

Cassandra felt the line inside her break. A queen knows when it is over. The sound that left her was not a command; it was a raw, human loss she had never allowed the wall to see.

Then she swallowed it back, forcing her spine straight again. If the wall fell, it would not fall because she did.

The city held its breath.

### Flank Broken

Inside, Cassandra whispered a grief she had never allowed herself to speak. *I'm sorry, Astraea.* For the friends buried, for the families starved, for the soldiers bleeding on her walls, for the city that had carried her crown. *I'm sorry.* And the name she never spoke in daylight. *Joseph.*

The living stared at the forming undead ranks with horror and confusion. “Saints preserve us—what sorcery is this?” a knight shouted, voice breaking.

They moved with discipline that made no sense for necromancy—shields locking as if waiting on a silent commander—but panic drowned thought. “Necrotic reinforcements!” rang down the wall.

An undead knight stepped up from behind the living line—half flesh, half bone, rot exposed. He did not attack. He lifted his chin toward the archers on their flank, voice rough but clear. “Archers—aim for the wings of their ranks. Make them cluster.”

“He speaks,” a soldier hissed, horrified.

“I am here to help,” the undead knight said, never looking at the living. “Joseph sent us. He will strike when they bunch. Do not waste this. We wait for his signal.”

“He commands the dead?” King Consort Aelius whispered, unable to comprehend.

Cassandra’s breath hitched hard; shock flared, then crashed into something fiercer. In a heartbeat she saw the truth she had refused to name: Joseph had been burning himself for years—commanding, striking, running his own war alone—to slow the Necrotic King’s purge while she kept him in exile. Guilt and furious love collided behind her eyes. The Paladin champion’s lip curled. “Blasphemy,” he spat.

“Shut your mouth and hold the line,” Cassandra snapped, voice like a blade. “He is saving your wall.”

The undead knight’s gaze flicked to her once. “Queen, hold your line. He comes through their center. When they tighten, we break them.”

Knights stared, seeing for the first time the discipline Joseph wielded. The Paladin swallowed his protest, chastened under Cassandra’s glare.

Bows trembled in living hands, revulsion warring with orders—but survival left no room to refuse.

Then the archers turned—not toward Astraea, but toward the Necrotic King’s advancing force—and loosed into his exposed flank. The volley hit like a wall of iron rain. Someone sobbed thanks to saints that never answered necromancers. A knight whispered, voice breaking, “Did he turn their dead against them?”

“Phalanx, center!” the undead knight called, voice cracking but firm. “Infantry, fall in behind. Prepare to advance and engage.”

The phalanx defenders formed in Cassandra’s center, shields locking, spears leveled. Infantry knights filled the gaps, bracing as if the city itself had stepped forward.

Relief hit first, then disbelief. Cassandra’s breath caught low in her ribs.

An arrow arced up from the eastern flank, head wrapped in fire—a mark in the sky, a signal of position.

The undead knight glanced at Cassandra. “Brace, Highness. You are about to learn why Death Knights are most feared.”

Cassandra took the warning into her lungs. *He has been doing this alone. He has been this for years. Hold.*

From the far edge of the field, a black‑armored rider cut into view, leading the charge as the flank caved. His ride was slow, deliberate, like a general steadying a break—one gloved hand raised, an unseen voice in every disciplined step of the undead cavalry. *Hold the line. Stay with me.* The cavalry punched through the gap; archers and infantry flowed in his wake; a phalanx locked shields like a wedge.

“Advance!” the undead knight barked as Joseph’s flank hit. “Push now!”

For a heartbeat, Cassandra forgot the war. She forgot the council, the walls, the years. The memory of his dismissal snapped like a tendon: the bow that felt like a knife, the last glimpse of his back at the gate. Her throat tightened, her pulse hammered at her wrists. Seeing him now felt like a wound reopening and finally bleeding.

She kept her face still for the wall to see. The line needed a queen, not a woman. Inside, everything broke and held at once. She let it, silently, where no one could take it from her.

Then she forced herself to breathe and gave him what she had always given him: restraint.

A cheer rose from the walls—shattered at first, then swelling. For the first time in weeks, it sounded like belief rather than defiance.

### Charge and Break

The cavalry struck the flank. Steel and bone crashed. The phalanx marched into the center, breaking the assault. The knight infantry filled the gaps.

The Necrotic King’s forces reeled, expecting submission and finding a wall of willing dead instead—quiet, disciplined, nothing like the Necrotic King’s shoddy masses.

They could not advance. There were not enough living to take ground, only enough to refuse its loss. The line understood it and held anyway, surrounded on all sides by dead that would not tire. A captain looked to Cassandra, then to the field, and saw the same truth she did: this was not a victory march. It was a moment carved out of ruin.

For the living, it was the first breath they had stolen back. For Cassandra and Joseph, it was the only kind of victory they were allowed—restraint held against a world that wanted dominion.

### Victory and Collapse

For a heartbeat, the capital stood behind an army of echoes. Astraea lived. The black rider staggered, Muramasa lowering. The glow in his eyes flickered.

He claimed the moment as victory with a nod to Cassandra across the field. Then he fell.

The summoned undead vanished in the same breath—archers, phalanx, cavalry dissolving into ash and silence. The warning was sudden and absolute: if he failed, there would be no wall of willing dead.

Living soldiers moved to reach him. Voices warned her off—orders, doctrine, tradition. Cassandra ignored them all. She went down from the wall, crossed the churned field, and reached him first.

“Majesty, no—” someone called.

She did not answer. She fell to her knees beside him and pulled his head into her lap. His face was cold, his breath uncertain. For a heartbeat she thought he was gone. The sound that left her was not courtly—it was a sob, raw and helpless.

“Joseph,” she whispered. “Please.”

The living reached them in a rush, a ring of exhausted bodies and broken shields. The Grand Maester forced his way through, hands already lifting in a familiar gesture. A pale barrier shimmered into place around them, a restraint-field to buy a single, fragile minute.

“Hold him to this side,” he said, voice steady. “He is not across. Not yet.”

She clutched him tighter, trembling.

“Then bring him back,” she said.

The Grand Maester nodded. “We will. But we do not force. We ask.”

Only then did the living lift them together and carry them back, because there was nothing left to carry him but the living.

### Price Paid

They bore him toward the city, unconscious, breath a thread. Cassandra did not let go until the gates closed behind them. Victory was bought with his last strength, recall spent once and answered in blood and bone.

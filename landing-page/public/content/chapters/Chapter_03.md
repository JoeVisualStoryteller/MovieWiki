## Chapter 3 — Before the World Broke

### Younger Days, Longer Shadows

Cassandra remembered calm days as something like a dream. The palace smelled of oiled wood and ink, not blood and smoke. Duty was a braid in her hair, a weight on her shoulders, a path laid out in front of her feet.

On that path stood a boy in black eyes and steady hands: Joseph, introduced as her Honor Guard. He bowed too deeply for a guard, too shallow for a servant, and met her gaze without flinching.

*His eyes were old, even then.*

### Routine and Recognition

Trust grew in silence. He matched her stride in the corridors, never closer than three paces, never farther than four. When she paused at a window, he paused. When she laughed at a joke from a visiting prince, he did not smile; his eyes measured the room instead.

There was a flicker once, in a hall of portraits. She stopped before a painting of her childhood betrothal ceremony—the one that never came to pass. The boy’s face was blurred by time and pigment. Joseph stood behind her. For a heartbeat, something like recognition passed over her skin.

She turned. “Have we met before?” she asked lightly.

His mouth opened, then closed. “I do not forget those I guard,” he said. Not an answer. A deflection wrapped in loyalty.

### A Minor Threat, A Major Lesson

When a would-be assassin slipped through the servants’ wing, Joseph moved faster than her eyes could follow. He intercepted with the flat of his blade, not the edge, and disarmed without killing. The man lived to confess. Cassandra watched Joseph’s restraint with a mixture of gratitude and unease.

“Why spare him?” she asked later.

“Because killing him teaches nothing new,” Joseph said. “Letting him speak reveals who sent him.”

Restraint, then, was not softness. It was strategy.

### Early Incursion

The first early warning came from the northern border—a small undead scouting party where none should be. Cassandra rode out with her father, the King, her mother the Queen, a Paladin champion in gleaming plate, and Joseph. Joseph’s matte armor swallowed the morning light; no echoes trailed him—this was meant to be observation, not a battle.

At the ridge, they saw the undead moving without the Necrotic King’s main force. A test. A provocation. Or bait.

“We should observe,” the King said.

“We should purge,” the Paladin said, drawing a holy blade. Oath-light flared. He charged, righteous and loud.

The undead fell beneath Oath and steel. The Paladin planted his banner, breathing hard. “As it should be.”

The fallen twitched. Fingers curled. Jawbones clicked. One by one, they reanimated, holy cuts still glowing.

“They return,” the Queen whispered.

“Oath Magic delays,” Joseph said, voice quiet. “It does not command finality.”

He stepped forward. His eyes flared with deathlight. He lifted one hand, fingers curling—a minimal call to rest, no summons needed. The undead crumpled. Not dramatically. Quietly. As if an invisible hand had asked them to rest forever, and they obeyed.

### The Necrotic King’s Eye

Across the ravine, a lone figure in bone and shadow manifested, air frosting around him. The Necrotic King himself, projection or presence, gaze fixed on the living.

He raised a hand. Cassandra felt her limbs pull, her parents sway, the Paladin’s breath hitch—as if unseen strings sought to lift them into undeath—a violation that felt wrong even to Cassandra, who knew Death Magic was not meant to touch the living that way.

Joseph slammed a barrier into place, a translucent curve of restrained death between the Necrotic King and the royal line. His eyes blazed. The barrier hummed, a low warning.

The Necrotic King smiled, slow and curious. A stycle-like blade formed in his hand, long and curved, a weapon of dominion.

Joseph answered by summoning Muramasa. The sword tore from shadow into his grip, honest and hungry. He moved faster than breath—pointing its edge at the Necrotic King’s throat before the stycle lifted.

For a heartbeat, they stood like dueling myths: King Arthur before Saxon lines, Death Knight before Necrotic dominion. Consent versus control. Restraint versus compulsion.

He did not leave immediately. His gaze slid to Cassandra, to her parents, to the Paladin straining against the barrier.

“You guard a throne with ghosts and guilt,” the Necrotic King murmured. “Did your crowns tell him he was meant for you, Princess? Or did the old thief keep that, too?”

Cassandra’s breath caught. Joseph’s jaw clenched; Muramasa hummed, eager.

“You will not touch them,” Joseph said. His voice was soft steel. “You have no consent here.”

The Necrotic King’s eyes gleamed. “Consent,” he repeated, tasting the word. “You wield restraint as if it can change what is coming. Astraea will open. Your paladins will falter. Your people will beg to rise for me.”

Joseph stepped closer, Muramasa’s point a whisper from bone. “You can compel many things. Not me. Not them.”

“You are immune to my call,” the Necrotic King conceded. “Interesting. A man I must kill rather than collect. A Queen who will learn what it is to lose choice.” He smiled wider. “I wonder what you will spend first—the love, or the restraint.”

For a heartbeat, time held. The barrier hummed with Joseph’s will. Muramasa’s edge hovered at the Necrotic King’s throat. Cassandra felt the future tighten and her stomach drop—a mix of fear and a furious, illicit pride.

Then the Necrotic King stepped back, laughter like cracking ice. “Finally. A man worth killing,” he said once, and dissolved into shadow, leaving the air colder and Cassandra’s heart pounding.

### Court Unease

Back in Astraea, unease spread like ink in water. The council whispered behind doors. Who commanded Joseph? What doctrine did he follow? What price did he exact? Grand Maester deflected questions with patient looks and riddles about cost and restraint.

### Marriage Politics

The old betrothal file—Cassandra’s childhood consort, chosen for politics and continuity—vanished from the archives. No one spoke of it. Instead, advisors suggested a new, scandalous bond: marry the deterrent, bind him to the throne, make Death Magic a dynastic tool.

“Absolutely not,” the High Priestess hissed. “No reigning monarch may wed a Death Knight.”

“I am not a Death Knight,” Joseph said quietly when asked. “I am Joseph.”

*A deflection, again. A truth and a lie at once.*

### Optics and Warnings

Advisors warned of optics. Paladins stiffened at the thought of Death Magic near the crown. The King Consort bristled: “We cannot seat a shadow beside you.”

Grand Maester, older than all of them, said nothing. His silence pressed Cassandra more than their noise.

### Exile by Gratitude

The council convened without Cassandra first. When she entered, they presented it as fait accompli.

“Joseph is to be thanked and released,” King Consort Aelius said. “As Honor Guard, he has done more than enough. As a political figure, he is…unsustainable.”

“Released where?” Cassandra asked. “To whom?”

“To the war,” Minister Leto said. “Let him do what he was made to do.”

Grand Maester’s eyes flicked down. He did not defend Joseph. Cassandra’s throat tightened with betrayal she could not voice.

Joseph bowed. “As you command,” he said. His eyes met Cassandra’s. *Choice*, they seemed to say. *Or exile dressed as gratitude.*

### The Search and the Brothel

She scoured the palace before he could ride—armory, training yards, the Reliquary—rooms he should never enter without her. Each turned up nothing but echoes. By the time she reached her chambers, a handmaiden was undoing the tight braid Cassandra had knotted herself.

“Majesty,” the handmaiden murmured, fingers gentle. “I saw a man in black armor at the Amber House. Drinking. Alone.” Her voice held no judgment; the Amber House was female-owned, staffed mostly by men. Women worked there too, but it was seen as lowering—Astraea’s gaze always weighed women more.

“Amber House,” Cassandra repeated. Her heart lurched. “Now.”

She ran. Guards scrambled to keep pace. Streets blurred. Lantern light spilled from the brothel like a challenge. Inside: silk-draped alcoves, soft laughter, men moving with practiced grace. At the far end of the bar, Joseph sat alone, gauntlet fingers around a cup of something brown and bitter, helmet on the counter. He was not entertaining. He was waiting out an order he had no choice but to obey.

She took the stool beside him. He did not look over until she spoke.

“This is where gratitude sends you?” she asked quietly.

He kept his eyes forward. “It is neutral ground. No council. No altar. If you ask it, I will stay.”

“If I ask, they will call it rebellion,” she said, the words harsh, cut from love. “They will make you a weapon I can never control.”

He turned, finally, eyes steady. “Then say the word and I refuse for you. Or let me go with your consent, not theirs.”

Her hand hovered over his; he waited. She let her fingers rest lightly on his wrist. “I do not consent to their exile,” she said. “But I cannot shield you if you stay.”

He exhaled, tension easing under her touch. “Then I go as yours, not theirs. Until you call.”

She took her hand back first. A single tear escaped; she did not wipe it. “Then go,” she said. “Return when I decide. Not before.”

He nodded once, stood, and left the cup untouched. The guards fell in as he departed. No herald. No banner. Only a queen watching a shadow leave with her permission, not her command.

### Years Unspoken

He rode out within a week. Matte armor. No banner. No herald. The city watched a shadow leave and did not know what it lost.

Years passed. In the capital, his name became a whisper, then a rumor, then a cautionary tale. At the borders, he became a myth—a black figure that made the dead pause, that cut command tents from the inside.

Cassandra received no letters. Grand Maester kept his box of sealed reports locked. The lever she had refused was gone, pulled out of reach by the very counsel that had advised caution.

*We pushed him into the dark and called it thanks.*

### The World Breaks

Without Joseph, the world broke on schedule. The Necrotic King’s empire pushed east, measured, relentless. Cassandra’s maps turned red. Her reserves turned to ash. The “deterrent” was no longer beside her; he was a rumor at the edge of the war.

Only when the war threatened to swallow Astraea whole did the council whisper the unthinkable: recall the shadow they had exiled.

Too late. Always too late.

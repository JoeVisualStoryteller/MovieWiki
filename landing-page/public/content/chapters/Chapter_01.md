## Chapter 1 — The Illusion of Choice

### Astraea, Wartime Court

Wide shot: a throne room built for ceremony, stripped to a war desk. Cassandra stands over maps that spill across marble like a second terrain. Red ink crawls eastward—borders already gone, cities about to stop sending grain, sons, breath.

Her voice cuts the room. “State your report.”

The youngest scout drops to one knee, dust still on his armor. “Western hemisphere is lost, Majesty. No messages from High Naruk. Their banners…turned black.”

A ripple of parchment and dread. King Consort Aelius tries to salvage pride. “We do not declare our own defeat.”

“We declare facts,” Cassandra answers. “Ink is clarity, not surrender.”

### Fragile Shields

Treaties are named like charms—southern alliances, eastern trade pacts, an island promise “should the need arise.”

“The need has arisen,” Cassandra says. “We have paper shields.”

She slices useless routes off the map. Every stroke doubles a ration, halves a day. The camera lingers on her hand—ink in place of blood.

### The First Collapse

“First city on the eastern flank fell last night,” another scout reports. “The gates opened from within. The dead walked out. The living were taken before they died.”

Silence. A priestess exhales disbelief.

“Reanimation in the East?” someone whispers.

“The Necrotic King does not honor geography,” Cassandra says. Doctrine breaks on screen: living seized while breath still steams in winter air.

### Strategy on a Knife-Edge

General Thane: “Fortify the northern passes. Make them pay for every stone.”

“Walls are delay, not strategy,” Cassandra replies.

Grand Maester, soft: “Delay has value.”

“Value is not victory,” she counters.

A breathless messenger arrives. “We have a victory at the border!”

The council drinks the word. Cassandra pins it down. “Define victory.”

“We held them a day. Until nightfall.”

“And then?”

“The fallen reanimated. We lost twice.”

The word sours. Hope bruises.

### The Illusion

Ledgers march: grain down, spears broken, oaths strained. The council recasts holding ground as triumph; Cassandra watches them weave illusion because breaking them with truth would break the city faster.

*If I lie, I break. If I tell them, they break.*

### Cassandra Alone with Maps

The council disperses. Wide to close: Cassandra kneels among maps, hands stained red.

Couriers had spoken like stones: “There was no battle. They fell, rose, marched.” She circles another city; ink bleeds.

Grand Maester from the shadows. “You cannot redraw the world with ink.”

“I can refuse their pretense,” she says.

He hesitates, carrying a secret weight. “There are…other measures.”

Her eyes sharpen. “Not yet. We use what we have.”

### The Black Figure

Night. A lone watchman sounds a single uncertain note. Cassandra climbs the parapet herself.

Through smoke and moonlight: a figure in matte black armor, lightless, moving like absence. Where it passes, the undead line shudders and stops. No helmet; eyes are not visible, but the air thickens.

“Who is that?” she whispers.

The watchman only stares. “A shadow, Majesty. It made them stop.”

Hope ripples—a rumor, not a song. Cassandra’s fingers bite stone.

“Seal this,” she orders. “No heralds. No hymns.”

Hold on her face: delay is proven possible. The illusion of choice cracks. Somewhere in the dark, a choice waits to be made—and a monarch’s order she has not yet dared to give.

## Chapter 14 — The Price of Truth

### Leak and Uproar
Whispers turned to shouts: sketches of Cassandra’s profile and a black-armor shadow passed hand to hand. Delegates clutched pearls; soldiers smirked; priests hissed. The taboo snapped taut.

Head Priestess: “The court will not accept this.”

Cassandra: “The court will accept what keeps them breathing.”

*Stomach hollow; spine straight,* she told herself. *I cannot let them make my love into a weapon against my crown.*

### Public Address
She stepped into the great hall alone. “Joseph is weapon of last resort, not ruler. He acts by consent, not command. Our doctrine is restraint.”

Murmurs—some softened, others sharpened to knives. The Paladin accuser’s eyes promised a trial.

### Paladin Accuser Builds
Outside, the accuser preached: “If she binds to death, Oath Magic dies.” Scrolls piled; allies courted with fear. Rumors named Joseph “shadow consort,” Cassandra “enthralled.”

### Violent Strike — Poisoned Chalice
At a delegation feast, a servant offered Cassandra wine. Joseph’s eyes flared; he flicked a thin Death Magic veil over the cup. The surface frosted, revealing oil slick poison.

He set the cup down. “Try again,” he said quietly. The hall froze. The servant bolted, seized by guards. Paladin accuser sneered. “See? Corruption.”

“See restraint,” Cassandra answered. “He saved your tongue from repeating a eulogy.”

### Joseph Offers Exit
Later, in a shadowed corridor, Joseph: “If I leave, you keep your throne.”

Cassandra: “If you leave, I lose restraint. I choose both. Stop offering to amputate yourself.”

### Internal Monologue — Throne vs Heart
*They will call me selfish for keeping him. They would call me weak for letting him go. The only honest path is the one we choose together, hated for truth instead of loved for lies.*

### Decoy Rejected Again
Council pressed a false betrothal. “Announce a duke to calm faith,” Leto urged.

“No,” Cassandra said. “I will not wear a lie to make you comfortable with restraint.”

### Coup Attempt and Blood
That night a faction moved to seize the armory. Joseph intercepted with blades drawn but sheathed. One noble swung an axe. Joseph parried, let the axe bite his forearm rather than unleash Muramasa. Blood dripped; he disarmed the man with his free hand.

“Drop it,” he said, voice ice. They dropped. He did not kill. The blood on stone spoke louder than any sermon.

Internal (Joseph): *Pain is cheaper than escalation. Spend blood, not the world.*

### Crowd Speech
At dawn Cassandra faced the square, brow scar still fresh from the thrown stone. “We stand because we choose restraint over dominion. Joseph is not your king. He is a shield we ask, not a crown we give. Fear will not dictate doctrine.”

Some faces softened. Some spat. Enough listened.

### Strike in the Street
As she descended, a zealot rushed with a hidden blade. Joseph’s barrier flared, sizzling the steel to slag and burning his own palm. He didn’t flinch until she was past.

Cassandra whispered without looking at him, “Thank you.”

He murmured, “Cost paid.”

### Collapse and Vigil
Hours later Joseph collapsed mid-training, forearm and palm wrapped, breath thin. Cassandra barred the council from the Reliquary. “He is not spectacle,” she warned.

Grand Maester: “He is finite. Every public fight hastens the end.”

Internal (Cassandra): *They will not see him shake. They do not get to use his cost as leverage.*

### Night Truths
In the dark, fingers laced, whispers raw.

Cassandra: “I’m afraid of losing you to doctrine.”

Joseph: “I’m afraid of becoming what they fear if I stop restraining.”

They held hands, breaths syncing. No forgiveness offered; only the choice to keep going, to let love be fuel for restraint instead of excuse for escalation.

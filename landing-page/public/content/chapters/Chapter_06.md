## Chapter 6 — The East Opens

### Silence Where Delay Once Stood

News from the front arrived without the strange pauses Cassandra had begun to count on. No blank corridors. No vanished command tents. No quiet zones carved by a black shadow and disciplined dead.

“Joseph?” she asked every courier. Every courier shook their head. He was elsewhere, far north, a rumor with no timetable.

*We learned to breathe in the gaps he made. Now there is only breath held tight.*

### The Machine Resumes

The undead advance returned to its mechanical rhythm. Lines marched. Drums pounded. Fallen rose before the blood on their armor dried. There was no hesitation, no stutter. The Necrotic King pushed as if the delays had never existed.

“Normal advance,” General Thane said grimly. “As if the pause was a dream.”

It was not a dream. It was a warning of how brief reprieve could be.

### Cities Without Reprieve

The first eastern city in their path collapsed before dawn. No mysterious reprieve. The gates opened under pressure, the dead poured in, and by sunrise the banners were black. Cassandra marked it in red ink and did not bother with circles for hope.

“We hold the next,” a councilor vowed.

“With what?” Cassandra asked. “Words? Paladins who fell once already?”

### Old Patterns Confirmed

Attrition returned with a vengeance. Bodies fell, rose, and fell again. Each “victory” cost more than it saved. Quartermasters showed her ledgers: numbers diving like birds in a storm.

“Holding ground is suicide,” Cassandra said. “We must move or we will drown standing.”

### Pleas for Aid

Messages poured in from the northern nations: pleas for aid, for corridors, for a shadow in black armor. Cassandra sent what she could—small detachments, grain measured in handfuls. It was not enough.

“Where is he?” the King Consort demanded.

“In the north, buying us days,” Cassandra said. “And burning himself to do it.”

### No Delay, Just Purpose

The undead moved with purpose now, as if insulted by delay. They probed for weak points, avoided the mountains they could not climb, and flowed around fortifications like water.

“They are learning,” Grand Maester said. “They adapt to absence as well as presence.”

### Capitals Fall Elsewhere

Word arrived that a northern capital—one that had once hosted Cassandra as a child—fell overnight. Banners torn down, population converted en masse. No heroic last stands, no songs. Just silence and marching.

*So easily a city can become a corpse.*

### Supply Lines Severed

Caravans vanished. Mountain passes were ambushed by living-turned shock troops. Routes Cassandra had trusted for years were suddenly murderous. Her quartermasters brought empty ledgers and panic.

“We cannot feed the capital and the refugees,” Minister Leto said.

“Then we ration,” Cassandra replied. “Everyone bleeds the same.”

### Encirclement

Astraea felt the circle tighten. Neighboring kingdoms fell or turned inward. The Great Rift no longer a boundary—it became a funnel. The city she ruled for containment now contained too much: fear, hunger, whispered anger.

### Phase Change

Reports shifted tone. Scouts spoke of the Necrotic King’s doctrine changing: living taken alive, bound to wagons, eyes vacant. Dominion doctrine, visible and obscene—choice stolen before death.

“He wants us alive,” the High Priestess whispered. “He wants us to kneel.”

“He will find no knees here,” Cassandra said. *He may find bones.*

### The Coast Burns

Coastal towns reported black sails and burning docks. The Eastern Incursion began in earnest; fishermen’s nets dragged up corpses still mouthing orders.

“We cannot hold the coast and the passes,” General Thane said.

“We will hold what buys us time,” Cassandra replied. “Not glory. Time.”

### Rationing

She signed decrees cutting rations in half. Silk budgets turned to iron. Festivals canceled. The city grumbled. Paladins preached endurance. Cassandra listened to empty stomachs through stone walls.

### Evacuations Fail

Evacuations clogged roads. Wagons overturned. Refugees turned back to find undead blocking the way they had come. Cassandra ordered new routes; the undead anticipated, appearing where she had hoped to guide them away.

“He is reading us,” Grand Maester said. “He knows our patterns.”

### Time Accelerates

Every day without delay cost ten in blood. Scouts died faster. Messages arrived with more ash than ink. Cassandra’s mornings began with loss and ended with ledgers.

*We are sprinting in a marathon. We will break unless the shadow returns.*

### Anxiety to Resolve

Joseph remained absent, years into his exile war, carving days elsewhere. Anxiety sharpened to resolve. Waiting became a choice she could not afford.

“We may have to recall him,” the King Consort said. “Damn the optics.”

“Optics are already ash,” Cassandra replied. “We will do it once, when we cannot stand without him.”

### The East Opens

She did not seal any orders yet. She marked Astraea’s gates with red ink and whispered to the map: *We may call you home.* The words stayed on parchment until the moment demanded them.

The east opened like a wound. Cassandra stood at its edge, hands stained, knowing that when she pulled the lever, there would be no second chance.

### Siege Coming

Within Astraea, masons reinforced parapets, archers drilled atop half-finished ramparts, quartermasters measured grain in hours. The capital braced for a siege it could not name yet—a pressure building in every stone, a silence before the drums reached the walls.

### North Collapses

Reports from the northern arc turned from ink to ash. Fortress-cities that had held for generations fell overnight; banners went black before dawn. Northern capitals Cassandra had visited as a girl were stripped of choice in a single push—populations seized alive, marched east as breathing cargo, then turned en masse. The Necrotic King did not pause to loot or rule; he erased, replaced, and moved on. Refugee trickles from the north stopped entirely. There was nothing left to run.

### Emergency Council — North Falls

They dragged the council back to the chamber before the dust settled. Maps updated in red as scouts spoke of empty capitals and living taken alive. Paladins stood rigid, knuckles white on hilts. Ministers whispered of allies already gone. Cassandra listened, face set.

“Joseph cannot be in two places,” Grand Maester said quietly. “He chose the north to buy us days.”

“Then the south will pay for it,” King Consort Aelius muttered, voice tight.

“We all pay,” Cassandra replied. “We decide how.”

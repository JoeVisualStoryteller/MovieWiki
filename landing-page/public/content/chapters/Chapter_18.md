## Chapter 18 — The Offer

### Parley Demand
The Necrotic King sent a horn blast and a banner of truce. “Parley at noon,” the herald croaked. Refusal would look like fear; acceptance was a trap. Cassandra stepped into it with eyes open.

Internal (Cassandra): *If he speaks to me without armies, I must answer. If I flinch, the council will claim dominion for him. Walk straight.*

### Together to the Field
Cassandra and Joseph walked side by side to the no-man’s land. Armor and cloak, scandal and awe trailing behind. Paladin accuser watched like a vulture.

### Dominion Offer
Necrotic King: “Yield. Joseph, serve me. Cassandra, rule under me. Dominion without cost.”

Cassandra tasted the poison in the peace. Joseph stood silent, eyes bright and hard.

### Rejection
Joseph: “Consent is not yours to take. Restraint costs. You refuse cost.”

Necrotic King’s smile was stone cracking. “Then ash.”

### Arrow in the Parley
A hidden archer from NK’s line loosed at Cassandra, breaking truce. Joseph snapped a barrier in front of her; the arrow shattered, shards slicing his cheek. Blood welled. He did not wipe it away.

Cassandra: “You cannot even keep your own word.”

Necrotic King: “Words are for the living. You will learn obedience.”

### Bond Exposed
He spoke of their bond as “dominion-lite.” Cassandra lifted her chin. “Our bond is consent. Yours is theft. Not the same.”

Internal (Joseph): *He will use our love as a blade. Refuse him every angle.*

### Threat of Faith
Paladin accuser scribbled, quill poised to turn parley into indictment. Joseph’s blood on his cheek fueled his sermon. Cassandra ignored him; the camera lingers on ink blots falling like drops.

### Letters for After
Back in Astraea, Joseph wrote letters—orders, farewells, instructions. His hand trembled; Cassandra pretended not to see, then placed her hand over his to steady.

Internal (Cassandra): *If he writes farewell, I will set the city on fire before letting him go alone.*

### Anchor Ritual Offer
Grand Maester: “One use. Catastrophic if repeated. It may anchor him or strand him.”

Cassandra: “We risk stranded, not unleashed.”

Joseph: “If it keeps me from dominion, I accept the leash of stone.”

### Accuser’s Threat
Paladin accuser: “Expose your vows or be tried.”

Cassandra: “Truth comes with or without your theatrics. Pick your stage.”

### Final Preparations
Walls warded, blades blessed, evacuation tunnels opened. Cassandra walked the walls, letting the city see her unflinching. Joseph stood at the gate, echoes gathering like fog.

They touched wrists briefly, a private liturgy: her pulse steadying his, his warmth steadying hers.

### Silent Vow
They shared a long look. No words. A vow to find each other in whatever came next—anchor or ash.

Dusk descended. War horn sounded. The offer was answered with resolve.

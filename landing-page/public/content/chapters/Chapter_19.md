## Chapter 19 — The Breaking Point

### Battle Ignites
Undead tide slammed the walls. Joseph unleashed measured Death Magic—barriers, precision strikes—each one a coin from a shrinking purse. Cassandra’s voice cut the roar: “Left flank pivot! Archers, eyes on living-turned!” Command as intimacy, each order also meant to keep him alive.

Internal (Joseph): *Spend slow. She needs me breathing. Astraea needs me as threat, not corpse.*

### Targeting Cassandra
Dominated archers aimed at her. Joseph threw cold barriers, blades flickering. Every deflection bled strength. An arrow grazed her pauldron; he snarled, a sound he hated, and tightened his control.

### Walls Crack
Inner wall shuddered; dust rained. Grand Maester began the anchor ritual in the Reliquary, chanting low, candles guttering.

Internal (Cassandra): *If the wall falls, I stand in the breach. If he burns, I trigger the anchor. Choose the moment without flinching.*

### Duel with Champion
Necrotic King’s champion, a massive living-turned brute, charged. Joseph met him. Steel rang. Joseph won, driving Muramasa through borrowed flesh, but his knees buckled. Breath ragged; hands tremored.

### Order to Fallback
He wanted to press. Cassandra saw him fray. “Fallback!” He hesitated. She tapped brow twice—signal they’d promised. He obeyed, retreating under protest, restraint reinforced by consent.

Internal (Joseph): *Obey her. Do not die a martyr to pride.*

### Violent Surge on Cassandra
Catapult stones wrapped in flaming chains hurled at the command tower. Joseph flung a wide Death Magic shield; chains slapped and hissed, sparks scoring Cassandra’s cloak. The shield cost him a gasp and a stumble; she steadied him even as fire rained.

### Necrotic King Enters
Necrotic King stepped onto the field. Air warped cold. “Again I offer,” he said.

Joseph’s silence was a blade. “No.”

### Anchor Pull
Joseph neared burn-out; eyes too bright. Cassandra lifted her hand—the anchor signal. Ritual snagged him mid-strike, dragging him into tethered elsewhere. He vanished; the Necrotic King staggered, momentarily surprised.

Internal (Cassandra): *I stole him from death. Now I must go steal him back from silence.*

### Gap and Push
Enemy faltered without their duel. Astraeans pushed; Paladins chanted; echoes struck on habit. Necrotic King withdrew, vow of return hanging like a blade.

### Quiet Battlefield
Silence. Joseph gone—alive, tethered elsewhere. Cassandra stood amid ash, crown heavy.

Internal: *He trusted me to pull him out. I will not leave him in that tether. I am Queen. I am searcher. Both or nothing.*

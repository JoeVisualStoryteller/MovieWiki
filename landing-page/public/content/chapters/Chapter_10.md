## Chapter 10 — The Cost of Continuance

### Recovery and Rumor

Joseph slept like a man dragging chains. Cassandra read casualty scrolls in the same room, pen scratching while his breath scraped. Outside, the city whispered: the legend returned, the black knight who saved them.

The council demanded he be seen, paraded as strength. Cassandra refused. “We do not turn cost into spectacle,” she said. “We protect it.”

### Testing Proximity

When Joseph woke, weak but alert, Cassandra stood close, then stepped back, watching his color. They tested proximity like scientists: how long before fatigue deepened, how quickly his eyes dimmed when she left.

“You stabilize me,” he admitted. “You also remind me what not to burn.”

“Then we ration each other,” she said.

### Council Pressure

Councilors pressed for visible deterrence. “Put him on the wall,” Minister Leto urged. “The people will be braver.”

“We need him alive, not ornamental,” Cassandra said. “We will not spend him to soothe your nerves.”

The Paladin champion muttered about “death worship” and “Queens enthralled.” Cassandra ignored him; the room did not.

### Incognito Walk

Against advice, Joseph walked the city incognito, hood up, eyes dimmed. He saw refugees huddled in courtyards, merchants trading rations for hope, children playing at being archers who shoot the dead in the flank.

He returned quieter. “They live because of restraint,” he said. “Not spectacle.”

### Internal Monologue — Restraint as Devotion

Alone, Joseph sat with Muramasa unsummoned. *Restraint is not fear. It is devotion— to her, to a world that still chooses. Power exists to test me. I choose her over escalation. Every time.*

### Warning from the First

Grand Maester visited. “Each use shortens your thread,” he said. “The capital siege cost years.”

“I know,” Joseph replied.

“Knowing is not restraint,” Grand Maester countered. “Choosing is.”

Joseph’s eyes flared, then softened. “I choose,” he said.

### Secret Accords

Cassandra drafted quiet accords to slow escalation: food routes rerouted, patrols doubled where Joseph would not go, alliances courted at the fringes. Optics be damned.

“You play a long game,” Aelius said.

“We can only win long,” she replied. “Short is death.”

### Night Raid

At night, Joseph moved alone. He found a covert necromancy cell in the lower docks—five men, a stolen ritual. He dismantled it with precision: blades, a barrier to contain screams, a whispered warning to the one who surrendered.

“Tell them restraint lives here,” he said, eyes glowing. “Tell them mercy ends where consent dies.”

### Rumors of Closeness

Rumor swelled: the Queen and the Death Knight, too often in proximity. Markets whispered, councilors smirked, Paladins scowled. Cassandra let it ride; truth would out when she chose.

### Public Ritual, Private Watch

At a public ritual, Cassandra stood alone, crown gleaming, voice steady. Joseph watched unseen from a shadowed column, eyes dim to avoid drawing attention. The people cheered her, unaware of the man in black three paces away.

### Internal Monologue — The Cost of Admission

On the terrace that night, Cassandra looked east. *Power is acknowledged and embodied by choice. The cost of admission is honesty. I will pay it when it buys us time.*

### Probing and Declining

Scouts reported Necrotic King probes on the outer defenses. Council clamored for Joseph to answer. He declined.

“They must hold without me,” he told Cassandra. “Or I become the only wall.”

She nodded, even as fear knotted her stomach. “Then we train them to hold.”

### Boundaries Codified

The Paladin order demanded written boundaries. “Define when he acts,” the champion said.

“When consent aligns and cost is clear,” Cassandra replied. “Not when you are afraid.”

The rule was not new. The fact that it was now inked made it a shield and a target.

### Night Terrace — Vow

Under moonlight, Cassandra and Joseph stood close, unseen. “We endure,” she said.

“We endure,” he echoed. They did not touch. The vow hung between them like a barrier and a bridge.

### Propaganda and Choice

Enemy propaganda seeped in: leaflets claiming Cassandra was enthralled, that Joseph was a tyrant in waiting. She burned them.

“Optics are ash,” she said aloud to an empty room. “Choice remains.”

She chose to ignore the narrative war and focus on the real one: keeping Joseph alive, keeping Astraea breathing, holding restraint as both shield and offering.

## Chapter 2 — Delay

### Uneven Silence

The first report of a stalled advance came in on boots caked with mud.

“Majesty,” the scout said, eyes darting. “They stopped. In the western corridor. For hours. No fighting. No bodies rising.”

Disbelief rippled through the war room. Cassandra felt hope flicker—small and sharp, dangerous to touch.

“Explain,” she said.

“We can’t,” the scout replied. “Their commanders were…missing. There were no heads to cut off. They were simply gone.”

### Theories and Weather

Clerics blamed weather. Generals blamed rumor. The High Priestess muttered about divine pause. Cassandra marked the map with a thin circle of ink. She wrote one word beside it: **Why?**

Hours later, a second scout, from a different front, reported the same: undead that did not rise. Command tents empty, lines disordered, the march stalled.

### No Coincidence

“Coincidence,” Minister Leto said. “Fog. Poor visibility. They will resume.”

“Two fronts,” Cassandra replied. “Two anomalies. That’s pattern, not coincidence.”

Grand Maester watched her mark the second circle. His face did not change. His eyes flickered toward the blank parchment from the lost corridor. He knew something. He always did.

### Sealed Reports

Cassandra sealed both reports with her private wax. “No heralds. No songs. Not yet.”

“Majesty, hope rallies morale,” King Consort Aelius said.

“False hope kills faster,” she answered. “We will not promise what we cannot explain.”

She placed the sealed scrolls in a box only she and the Grand Maester could open.

### Quiet Corridors

The delay spread in patches, uneven as spilled oil. Where the undead paused, civilians ran. Refugees flooded through gaps that should not exist, carried by luck and a shadow they could not name. Some spoke of silent skeletons marching with the shadow—disciplined, controlled, striking and vanishing.

“Someone is interdicting their command,” General Thane said in a rare whisper. “We find them, we control this war.”

“We don’t control what we don’t understand,” Cassandra replied. “We observe. We protect. We do not expose our phantom or those he commands.”

### Ink and a Missing File

Late, by candlelight, Cassandra marked the quiet zones on her own maps. In a margin she wrote a name she had not spoken aloud in years: **Joseph?**

### Silence as Strategy

She enforced silence with precision. Messengers were vetted twice. Loose tongues were reassigned to the farthest outposts. The High Priestess bristled at secrecy; Cassandra let her bristle.

“If we shout hope too soon,” Cassandra told her, “the Necrotic King will hear us louder than the people will.”

### The Black Figure Again

Night on the northern wall. A watchman lifted a lantern and pointed. There, in the distance, the same black matte figure moved along the ridge, cutting through the undead line with surgical absence.

“Shadow,” the watchman whispered. “He makes them slow.”

Cassandra’s breath hitched. *Joseph? Or another Death Knight?*

Grand Maester appeared beside her, as if he had been standing there forever.

“You cannot control him,” he said quietly.

“I do not wish to,” she replied. “I wish to not lose him.”

His silence was assent and warning both.

### The Necrotic King Notices

Word came from spies embedded in the enemy: the Necrotic King had paused to sniff the wind. His scouts turned hunters, probing for the phantom hand that erased his command posts.

“He is aware,” Cassandra said to her council. “And he is hunting.”

“Then we should shout our thanks and draw him here,” Minister Leto argued, voice shaking with the thrill of strategy.

“We draw nothing until we know the cost,” Cassandra answered.

### Hope Whispered, Not Sung

In the markets, rumors of a black-armored ghost spread. Children drew him in chalk on walls. Mothers whispered that the dead could be stopped. Cassandra let the whispers live and killed any attempt at song.

*Hope whispered is a candle. Hope sung too early is a beacon for the enemy.*

### Pressure Shifts

As the quiet zones grew, pressure migrated. The undead adapted, pushing harder where the phantom had not walked. Cassandra stretched her forces thin, praying the circle on her map would move before her lines broke.

“We need to speak to him,” General Thane said.

“We need him alive,” Cassandra replied. “Speaking may get him dead.”

### Partial Truth

King Consort Aelius pressed again. “We should tell the people. Inspire them.”

“Tell them what? That a man we exiled is saving us in secret?” Cassandra asked. “We do not have the right to use him as a story.”

Grand Maester’s gaze softened, barely. “He may be beyond your right to protect,” he murmured.

“Then we give him choice,” she said. “When he lets us.”

### Ink Spreads

The ink circles expanded. Cassandra watched her own handwriting redraw the war. In some places, she wrote **delay**. In others, she wrote **trap?** and underlined it twice.

She slept in her chair. She dreamed of black armor and eyes that glowed with restrained death. She woke with an ache she refused to name.

### The Hunt Begins

At dawn, a courier from the shadowed front arrived with an arrow in his shoulder. “Majesty…he is being hunted. The Necrotic King sends living scouts. They die silent.”

“And him?”

“He does not stay,” the courier said. “He moves. He is…thin.”

*Cost,* Cassandra thought. *Everything has cost.*

She opened the box of sealed reports and added one more. Then she sent for the Grand Maester.

“We will find him,” she said. “And this time, we will not let him go.”

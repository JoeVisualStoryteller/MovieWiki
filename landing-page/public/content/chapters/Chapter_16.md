## Chapter 16 — Drawing the Line

### Heart of the Enemy
Recon brought maps of the Necrotic King’s supply heart—bone caravans, necromancer forges, grain stolen from the west. Cassandra authorized a deep strike. “Cut his fuel,” she said. “Limit his reach. We choose the field.”

Internal (Cassandra): *Every strike I order is a brick in my own trial. Order anyway.*

### Infiltration Team
Joseph picked his team: paladins, rogues, one death mage apprentice, two echoes. “Silence first,” he told them. “If we are seen, we have already overspent.”

He brushed Cassandra’s wrist before leaving—permission asked, granted in a glance.

### Sabotage
They ghosted through ravines. Joseph cloaked them with thin Death Magic veils, air frosting. Charges lit bone piles; supply stacks collapsed inward. Joseph’s eyes flared, dimmed, flared again. Cost tallied in his breath.

Internal (Joseph): *Cut the fuel, not the living. No dominion. Quick, clean, out.*

### Retreat Under Pursuit
Enemy riders gave chase. Cassandra held the gate open via Oath Magic proxy, voice in Joseph’s ear through a loyal paladin. “Run. Come back to me.”

He stumbled through, collapsing into her arms. Echoes dissolved at the threshold. Smoke clung to his hair; her fingers smelled of ash when she steadied him.

### One More Push
Grand Maester: “He needs full stop.”

Cassandra: “One more push remains. We decide when.” Her eyes dared anyone to argue.

Internal (Grand Maester): *She will spend him anyway. Pray she chooses the moment wisely.*

### Political Ultimatum
Council delivered parchment: public marriage to the Death Knight equals abdication. Cassandra read, folded, burned it over a candle. “Threat noted,” she said. “Irrelevant.”

### Accuser’s Threat
Paladin accuser hissed, “Hidden vows doom you.”

Cassandra: “They bind us to restraint. Your fear binds you to blasphemy.”

Joseph stood behind her, silent, eyes bright with the effort of not reacting.

### Plague Attempt
Vials arced into the outer ward—glass bombs of plague. Joseph snapped a Death Magic dome, freezing droplets midair, then crushed them with a gesture. The strain drove him to one knee, sweat cold.

Paladin accuser: “You wield death on the living!”

Joseph: “I prevented it. Learn the difference.”

### Bedridden
He lay in the Reliquary, skin grey. Cassandra governed above, slipping down between decrees. She read casualty lists to him; his hand squeezed when she paused. Anchor enough to keep her upright.

Internal (Cassandra): *If he dies here while I sign grain ledgers, I will drown this council in their own ink.*

### Promise
“I won’t let you be left behind,” she said. “If you fall, I search forever.”

He managed a faint smile. “Then I will make it hard to find me.” Humor as shield; breath as currency.

### Dawn Rumble
Earth trembled. Scouts: NK’s final army gathers. Joseph rose before sun, buckling armor with shaking fingers. Cassandra watched, hands itching to unbuckle him instead.

“We choose together,” she said.

He nodded. “Together.” Muramasa remained unseen—for now.

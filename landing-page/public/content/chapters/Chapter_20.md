## Chapter 20 — The Search and the Duel

### Aftermath
Astraea held, barely. Joseph absent, the city mourned and moved. Cassandra stabilized the walls, appointed a regent, packed for a journey no queen had ever taken.

Internal (Cassandra): *I am queen and seeker. If I stay, I lose him. If I go, I risk the realm. I choose him because without him, the realm ends anyway.*

### Tracing the Anchor
Grand Maester traced anchor residue, opening a path into The Quiet. “You may not return,” he warned.

“I will,” Cassandra said. “With him.”

### Council Objection
Council: “The realm needs its Queen.”

Cassandra: “It needs its deterrent more. I leave a regent. I reclaim what keeps us alive.”

The Paladin accuser snarled, “If you are lost, faith shatters.” She ignored him.

### Liminal Path
Cassandra entered the liminal path, oath circle around her, secret rings on her fingers. The world hushed; echoes of fallen Death Knights whispered directions. Her breath frosted; each step was an oath.

### Joseph Adrift
Joseph floated in tethered elsewhere, tether fraying. The Necrotic King’s presence pulsed nearby, hunting.

Internal (Joseph): *Hold the tether. Hold for her. Do not let dominion steal what love anchored.*

### Confrontation Alone
Necrotic King appeared. “No armies here. Only will. Yield.”

Joseph: “Restraint costs. You refuse cost. I refuse you.”

### Sever Attempt
Necrotic King clawed at the tether, trying to sever Cassandra’s pull. Joseph bled strength to keep it alive. His fingers tremored; his jaw locked.

### Cassandra’s Approach
She followed echoes; love was compass. She heard his breath fray through the tether, quickened her pace.

Internal (Cassandra): *If I lose him here, I will tear the Quiet apart with my hands.*

### Threshold
She reached them locked in will. “Release him,” she said. Authority, not plea. Consent embodied.

### Final Duel
They clashed—restraint versus dominion. Joseph called willing echoes one last time; their forms flickered, consented to the end. Cassandra anchored consent, her presence the tether that held him steady.

Necrotic King faltered, wounded by a doctrine he could not comprehend. “You could have ruled worlds,” he hissed.

“We chose each other,” Cassandra said. “Not you.”

### Dominion Fractures
Dominion links snapped. Outside, undead ranks crumbled, confusion rolling through the horde like a silent scream.

### Snap Back
The anchor snapped. Joseph collapsed into Cassandra’s arms, alive. They tumbled back toward Astraea, dragged by ritual recoil.

### Dawn
They emerged on the battlefield. Dawn crept over ash. Councilors saw the bond; the taboo became a public question.

Cassandra lifted her chin. “We rebuild. We choose restraint. If he is lost again, I search again.”

Joseph leaned on her, eyes dim but alive. “We remain,” he whispered.

### Provisional Peace
Undead armies crumbled. Allies secured the field. Peace arrived provisional, not restorative. Cassandra held Joseph’s hand—crownless king in private, deterrent in public.

Internal (Joseph): *Alive, with her. Restraint won. Now we pay the price of surviving.*

### What Comes After
They stood at the wall, looking at a world that had survived delay. Healing would be another war—political, spiritual, personal. Together, they would choose restraint again, again, and again.

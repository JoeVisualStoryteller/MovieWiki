## Chapter 7 — The Choice

### Inevitability Named

By the time the council gathered again, the ink on Cassandra’s maps had turned every border red. The quiet zones were gone. The undead pushed on all fronts. The capital felt the rumble of distant drums.

“Delay alone will not save us,” Cassandra said. No one contradicted her this time.

*Hope whispered bought us days. Now days are gone. Choice or ruin.*

### Recall as Heresy

“We recall him,” General Thane said, blunt. “Once. Or we die waiting for miracles.”

“We do not summon death to the capital,” the High Priestess snapped. “Optics will destroy us. The Paladin Order will withdraw.”

The Paladin champion—the same who had watched his kills reanimate at the border—stood stiff at the back, jaw tight. He said nothing, but his glare was a threat.

“Optics are ash,” Cassandra replied. “We need him.”

*If we wait for them to breach the walls, we do this with fire at our backs. Better to choose the siege than be chosen by it.*

### Cost on the Table

Grand Maester spoke, voice low. “Every call burns his thread. Recall him, and you spend him faster. Do so with eyes open. And do it once.”

“We do so with eyes open,” Cassandra said. “And with consent. We ask. We do not command.”

King Consort Aelius shook his head. “You risk the throne to save the city.”

“I risk the city to keep a throne worth having,” she answered.

*The lever is him. The bill is mine.*

### Duty Versus Doctrine

Generals argued duty; priests argued doctrine. Some councilors whispered that asking for Joseph made them weak, made them look like necromancers’ kin. Others whispered that refusing made them dead.

“History weighs here,” Cassandra said. “We killed the Order once. We will not kill the last deterrent by pride.”

“We vote no recall,” the High Priestess said. Nods followed—most against, a few abstaining. Only General Thane raised a hand in favor. Cassandra saw the tally and let it stand.

“Noted,” she said. “I will do it anyway.”

### Partial Truth for the People

“We tell the people nothing,” Minister Leto urged. “We spin resilience. We give them hope without shadows.”

“We give them survival,” Cassandra countered. “Hope without substance is cruelty.”

She chose a middle path: no public recall, no banners, no heralds. Only sealed orders under night. The truth would come later, if there was a later.

“A secret recall is cowardice,” the High Priestess hissed.

“A loud recall is suicide,” Cassandra replied. “Choose which sin you prefer.”

*Public recall invites the Necrotic King to strike the messenger. Multiple recalls burn him out. We get one—quiet, consented, timed. Anything louder is theater and death.*

### South Collapses

While they argued, the south of the eastern hemisphere fell in columns of smoke. Messengers staggered in, ash-coated, reporting black sails and docks burning, populations herded onto undead ships to be converted alive. Inland, grain towns went silent as supply lines were severed; caravans never arrived. The southern trade spine snapped. By the time the council reconvened, the map’s lower half was inked black. The Necrotic King had finished the north; now he swept south and turned toward the only eastern capital left: Astraea.

*Joseph cannot be in two places at once,* Cassandra realized, watching messengers collapse on stone. *He chose to buy us days; the south pays while we pull him east.*

### Emergency Council — South Falls

They convened again within hours, ash still on the floor. Reports piled: coastal cities gone, inland towns silent. The Paladin champion slammed a fist on the table. “We cannot fight this alone.”

“We already are,” Cassandra said. “Now decide: recall, or watch the south join the north.”

The High Priestess closed her eyes. “If we recall, we burn him.”

“If we don’t, we burn everything,” Cassandra replied. “One recall. Once. With consent.”

### Public Recall Rejected

High Priestess pounded her staff. “A public recall is desperation. We keep our composure. We keep our faith.”

“Faith does not hold walls,” Cassandra said. “Stone and will do.”

### Quiet Recall Proposed

She laid the plan out like a battle: messengers vetted twice, routes mapped to avoid undead patrols, guard rotations rearranged to create corridors for his return.

“We whisper,” she said. “We do not shout. We preserve his path.”

“This is skulking,” the Paladin champion muttered.

“This is survival,” Cassandra said. “And restraint. We do not drag him here to make him spectacle.”

### Guards Reassigned

Captain of the Guard frowned at his new orders. “These rotations leave gaps.”

“They leave space,” Cassandra said. “For one man and his shadows.”

He saluted. The Paladin champion watched, suspicion a blade at his hip.

### Sealed Orders

In her chamber, Cassandra pressed her private seal into wax again and again. Each scroll bore risk, her name, and a promise she had no right to make: *Come home. The capital will hold as long as it can.*

“These will fracture us politically,” Aelius said, watching her hand cramp. “Allies will balk.”

“Allies can balk,” she said. “The dead will not.”

*If he answers, he burns faster. If he does not, we burn without him. My order, my consequence.*

### Joseph Unaware

Riders left under moonlight, cloaked and armed. None returned with an answer. Joseph was still moving independently in the north, raiding command nodes with his elite dead. He had no time to read parchment. He did not know he was being recalled.

### Silence Enforced

Rumor moved faster than horses. Cassandra strangled it. Messengers were shadowed. Tongues that wagged were reassigned to the farthest supply routes. The Paladin accuser began to mutter in corners about “death worship” and “Queens who court shadows.”

### The Necrotic King Waits

Spies reported a pause in the Necrotic King’s advance. He was sniffing the wind, sensing movement, waiting. It was the most terrifying mercy Cassandra had ever felt.

“He knows something shifts,” Grand Maester said. “He will strike when it favors him.”

“Then we strike first,” Cassandra murmured. “With choice, not panic.”

### Council Dismissed

At last, words ran out. Cassandra dismissed the council. The Paladin champion lingered a heartbeat too long, eyes on her empty ring finger, then left with a clatter of holy steel.

### Cassandra Alone with Maps

Alone, Cassandra stood over her maps. Hands trembled over inked borders. She traced the path she hoped Joseph would take, marked in pencil so she could erase it if hope failed.

*He does not answer. He is burning himself somewhere else. And still I call him home.*

### Choosing the Path

She reviewed routes for lowest cost. Mountain passes clogged. River barges at risk. Airspace patrolled by necrotic wyverns. She chose the path with the fewest red marks—not safe, merely less lethal.

### Orders Authorized

She lit a single candle. “Authorizing recall,” she whispered to the empty room. It was a prayer and an order. She pressed her seal one last time.

*Joseph, I am spending you. I do it with eyes open. Forgive me or don’t—just come.*

### No Announcement

The city woke to ration decrees and patrol notices. No one heard the word *recall*. No herald rode with news of shadows coming home. Markets opened. Children chased dogs. Ignorance remained mercy.

### Choice Locked

Later, standing on the terrace, Cassandra looked east. The horizon was dark. Somewhere beyond it, Joseph moved like a knife, burning down his thread. Somewhere beyond it, the Necrotic King paused, a predator scenting prey.

“Come home,” she whispered to the night. “Or we end here.” Her throat tightened; the words felt like betrayal and salvation braided together.

The choice was locked. Cassandra owned it. The bill would come due soon.

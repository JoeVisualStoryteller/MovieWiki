## Chapter 15 — The Intimacy of War

### Tactical Intimacy
Maps became a shared bed. Fingers traced routes instead of skin; breath synced over logistics instead of whispers. Joseph’s hand hovered over hers when he pointed flanks; she let it linger a heartbeat longer than necessary.

### Experiments in Proximity
They tested endurance like scientists. “Two hours before tremor,” Grand Maester noted when Cassandra stood within arm’s reach. Cassandra stepped closer anyway. Relief and guilt braided in her exhale.

Internal (Cassandra): *My presence steadies him. My love costs him. We ration each other like grain.*

### Emissary’s Offer
A Necrotic King emissary bowed low. “Yield; Astraea becomes vassal; your Death Knight serves a god.”

Joseph: “There is no god of consent in you.”

The council executed the emissary. Cassandra watched the body burn, eyes dry. Joseph’s fingers brushed hers, asking if she needed comfort. She shook her head once. *Comfort later. Resolve now.*

### Fringe Alliances
Cassandra met fringe envoys. “We offer restraint doctrine. Stand with us or be swept.” Some signed out of fear, others because her spine convinced them. Joseph watched from shadow, measuring who glanced at him with awe or terror.

### Paladin Accuser Confronts
The accuser cornered Cassandra in a cloister. “You consort with death. Step down or face faith.”

“I face faith with truth,” she replied. “Restraint is not blasphemy; dominion is.”

He spat near her feet. Joseph was there in the next beat, hand on the hilt he refused to draw.

“Do not spit at your Queen,” he said softly. The accuser backed away, fury banked, sermon sharpened.

### Archive Gift
Grand Maester laid an archive of fallen kings on the table. “Know what happens when crowns chase Death Knights.”

Cassandra read until her eyes blurred. Alone, she wept into the margins. Internal: *Every story ends in blood or exile. Ours must end in restraint or not at all.*

### Comfort and Confession
Joseph found her, tears not yet dry. “My thread is shorter than you think,” he admitted. “Every call frays it.”

“Then we ration you harder,” she said, thumb brushing his cheek. “And I carry more.”

Internal (Joseph): *Her touch steadies, not feeds. I cannot let gratitude become dependency. Choose restraint even in closeness.*

### Signal to Retreat
They set a signal: two fingers to brow. “If you do this, I order retreat. Optics be damned,” Cassandra said.

“Promise you’ll give it,” he replied. “Promise you’ll obey,” she countered.

“I promise,” he said. Cost settled between them.

### Mountain Pass
Enemy forces stormed a mountain pass. Joseph refused to flood the gorge with Death Magic; he used terrain, rockfalls, and a single cold barrier to redirect a vanguard. Losses stung. The line held.

Internal (Cassandra): *I will take the blame in council so he doesn’t have to spend a drop more.*

### Secret Vows Witnessed
Under moonlight in the Reliquary, Grand Maester sealed their vows again. A Paladin splinter witnessed in silence, excluded accuser fuming elsewhere. Rings unseen, oaths spoken under breath.

After, Joseph rested his forehead against Cassandra’s. “We are married in shadows,” he said.

“And we rule in light,” she replied. “Both truths at once.” They did not kiss; restraint remained their intimacy.

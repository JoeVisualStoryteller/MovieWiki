## Chapter 17 — The Siege of Will

### Walls Braced
The Necrotic King advanced. Astraea braced: inner walls reinforced, civilians pulled inward, caches sealed. Cassandra’s orders came clipped, no room for panic.

Internal (Cassandra): *If I show fear, they break. If I show him, they demand. I show neither—only command.*

### Echo Deployment
Joseph lined the outer rings with echoes, keeping core strength at the gate. Paladins chanted Oaths; Death Magic hummed low. Air tasted of iron, frost, and dread.

### First Clash
Undead surged. Joseph carved command nodes with surgical strikes, refusing overreach. Living-turned vanguard hit the walls; he chose breach risk over burn-out.

### Violent Strike on the Queen
Mid-clash, a catapult stone wrapped in hooks arced toward the command tower where Cassandra stood. Joseph snapped a Death Magic barrier; stone shattered, hooks whipping past her face and carving her cheek. Blood beaded. He hissed at the cost; his knees dipped.

Cassandra wiped the blood, kept her gaze on the field. *Do not give them the satisfaction of seeing you flinch.*

### Tactical Withdrawal
She ordered a pull to the inner wall. “Optics be damned. We keep lives.” Pride bruised; survival intact.

Internal (Joseph): *She orders retreat so I don’t have to spend. Obey.*

### Infirmary Weight
Grand Maester tallied cost. “He frays,” he told Cassandra, watching Joseph’s breath hitch between sorties.

Internal (Cassandra): *Every flare of his eyes is a coin from a dwindling purse. Spend slower.*

### Night Counsel
On the parapet, night wind cutting. Cassandra: “Not yet. Restraint until restraint fails.”

Joseph: “When it fails, I won’t have much left.”

She touched his wrist. “Then I decide when you burn. Not the enemy. Not the council.”

### Necrotic King Appears
At dawn, the Necrotic King loomed on the horizon. Air dropped ten degrees. Doctrine embodied.

### Summoning Echoes of Old
Joseph called echoes of fallen Death Knights—consented legends. Armor clinked like memory. Cassandra watched taboo turn to necessity. Paladins swallowed hymns.

### Almost Escalation
In battle, Joseph staggered, eyes blazing too bright. He nearly unleashed more. Cassandra grabbed his arm, blood from her cheek smearing his vambrace. “Not without my consent.”

His glow dimmed. Restraint restored, barely.

Internal (Joseph): *Her touch is anchor, not leash. Hold because she asks, not because I fear myself.*

### Brief Reprieve
After hours, the enemy fell back to regroup. Astraea still stood. Joseph leaned against the wall, shaking. Cassandra stood beside him, cheek bandaged, eyes on the horizon where dawn refused to break.

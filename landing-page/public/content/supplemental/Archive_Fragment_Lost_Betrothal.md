### Extracted Text (hand-copied; damage noted)

> *…the undersigned recognize the strategic union of Crown and deterrent, binding the Princess Cassandra to the firstborn heir of House Vale. The Crown acknowledges the necessity of restraint embodied and deterrence at the borders; House Vale acknowledges obligation to the Crown and its doctrine of consent…*
>
> *…the betrothed heir shall be fostered at court upon reaching ten years, trained under the Grand Maester in matters of restraint and statecraft; no Oath Magic shall compel him; no Paladin may assume command over him; his duty is to the Crown’s consent alone…*
>
> *…marriage to be solemnized upon ascension of Cassandra to the throne, contingent on mutual consent and political stability…*

Margin note in a different hand (later): *“Withdrawn under emergency. Subject lost. Record sealed.”*

Burn mark across lower third; ink blurred beyond recovery.

### Grand Maester’s Private Note (tucked into the bundle)

*I broke this contract to prevent a world-ending war. I stole a child bound for Cassandra and forged him into deterrent. I renamed him Joseph to bury what I did. Consent was broken. I justify nothing; I record everything. If this is found, I am either dead or about to be.*

— Grand Maester Alaric

### Observations (by current archivist)

- The ring enclosed is iron, inscribed with restraint oaths, sized for a child—consistent with Death Knight initiates, not courtiers.
- The linen strip bears initials **J.V.**, not “Joseph.” Likely original name of the heir.
- Removal from rolls appears political, not clerical. Corroborates rumor of a “lost betrothal” and the Grand Maester’s subsequent secrecy.
- Exposure of this document would undermine the taboo narrative that no monarch has ever bound to a Death Knight; it proves intent predated doctrine panic.

**Access:** Restricted to reigning monarch, Grand Maester, and their designated heir. Unauthorized possession punishable by exile or worse.

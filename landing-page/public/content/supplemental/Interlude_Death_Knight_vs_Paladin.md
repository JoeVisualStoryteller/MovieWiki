## Interlude — Death Knight vs Paladin

### Placement
Fits after Chapter 14’s rising doctrinal tension, before the siege tightens (Chapters 17–18). Can be referenced later during the accuser’s trial push.

### Setting
A cloistered training yard at dawn. Stone slick with mist. No crowd, but word will spread. Cassandra sanctions the bout to “settle doctrine without sermons.” The Paladin accuser arrives in ceremonial armor, Oath Magic humming. Joseph comes helmetless, Muramasa unsummoned.

### Stakes
No death. First to disarm or pin. The Paladin wants a public win to prove Death Magic’s blasphemy. Joseph wants to end the stalking and force boundaries without killing faith.

### Opening
Paladin: “You cannot love a queen and wield death. Choose.”

Joseph: “I already did. Restraint.”

They circle. Oath Magic glows gold, Death Magic cold in Joseph’s breath.

### Exchange — Doctrine in Motion
The Paladin strikes hard, overhead blows that ring the yard. Joseph parries barehanded, catching blades in gauntlets, refusing to summon echoes. Each block costs breath; his eyes flare then dim deliberately.

Paladin: “Show them your true nature!”

Joseph: “Restraint is my nature.”

The Paladin invokes Oaths of Purity; his blade glows. Joseph steps aside rather than contest raw force, using minimal Death Magic to thicken air at the Paladin’s feet—slowing, not dominating.

### Near Break
A feint catches Joseph’s shoulder; steel bites. Cassandra inhales sharply. Blood beads; Joseph refuses Muramasa. He shoves the Paladin back with a restrained Death Magic pulse that crackles but does not seize choice.

Internal (Joseph): *Do not escalate. Pain is cost, not permission.*

### Turning Point
The Paladin lunges, aiming at Joseph’s throat. Joseph redirects, twists the Paladin’s wrist, and locks his blade arm. Instead of breaking it, he freezes the steel with a whisper of cold, fusing hilt to gauntlet.

Paladin struggles; Joseph holds. “Yield. Consent matters even in duels.”

### Yield
Silence. The Paladin’s Oath Magic flickers. He hisses, “I do not yield to death.”

Joseph: “Then yield to your Queen.”

Cassandra steps forward. “Yield,” she says. Royal command, not dominion.

The Paladin bows, fury in his eyes, hand still frozen to his weapon. Yield is spoken. The bout ends.

### Aftermath
Grand Maester thaws the blade. The Paladin stalks off, sermon unborn. Soldiers in shadow murmur: Death Magic restrained, Oath Magic checked.

Internal (Cassandra): *He will not forgive. But now the city has seen restraint as skill, not blasphemy.*

Internal (Joseph): *I spent breath, not lives. They will twist this anyway. Keep the doctrine visible: no dominion, even when provoked.*

### Wound and Win

Blood seeps through Joseph’s tunic; his left hand slickens on the gauntlet. He does not let the tremor show until the Paladin is gone. Cassandra orders a cloth; he stays upright by will alone, breath thin, victory bought with coherence. Only when the yard empties does he sag against stone, accepting her steadying hand. He won—wounded, restrained, doctrine intact.

### Fallout Hook
The Paladin accuser escalates politically, unable to win in combat. He adds “public duel” to his list of grievances, fueling the later trial threat. The rank-and-file, however, carry a different story: the Death Knight chose not to kill when he could have. Faith fractures along that line.

## Interlude — Western Raid for Breath

### Context
Placed between ration collapse (Chapter 12) and the bridge strike (Chapter 13). Astraea starves; council forbids offensive sorties. Joseph disobeys quietly to buy time, using only willing echoes to avoid spending living lives and to keep dominion off the table.

### Orders Refused
Council chamber, midnight. Cassandra: “We do not spend you on grain.” Councilors echo her. Joseph inclines his head, says nothing, leaves. Grand Maester watches, knowing silence is not agreement.

### Departure
Reliquary gate. Joseph calls a lean cadre: archers, a phalanx wedge, a cavalry captain—willing echoes answering from the edge of finality. Consent whispered; Muramasa remains sheathed. He rides west under moon. No living accompany him.

### Target — Logistics Hub
West ridge, near a burned market town. A Necrotic King logistics center: wagons of grain, leather, metal, draft animals penned; overseers are living-turned, eyes flaring with imposed will. Undead rank-and-file stacked in rows, dormant until ordered.

### Plan
Cut command nodes first, never seize the living. Take supplies, not ground. Leave the mass undead entangled with echoes. No escalation; minimal Death Magic for hinges, locks, and silence.

### Insertion
Fog hugs the ground. Echo archers pick sentries silently. Phalanx wedge slides through alleys of wagons. Joseph places cold sigils on gate pins—hinges freeze and drop without a clang. Muramasa stays unseen; eyes glow only long enough to seal the oaths.

### Strike
Living-turned overseer raises a horn. Joseph reaches him in three strides, fist to throat, blade still sheathed. “No choice,” Joseph whispers—not command, a mercy. Overseer falls; the horn never sounds.

Echoes cut the remaining command nodes. Undead stir, confused without orders. Joseph refuses to call more; he accepts messy edges over cost.

### Extraction Signal
Three blue flares rise—pre-arranged with Astraean scouts shadowing miles back. Wagons creak as living drivers—woodcutters turned smugglers—rush in to seize reins. Joseph: “Do not fight. Do not praise. Move.”

### Rear Guard
Pursuit forms late—an undead patrol and a few living-turned stragglers. Joseph uses a thin barrier to collapse a small bridge behind the convoy, breath catching. Echo archers slow the rest. He refuses to summon Muramasa.

### Cost
His vision doubles; he leans on invisible weight. An echo cavalry captain nods once, holds the line until the convoy is clear, then dissolves with a salute. Joseph staggers but stays mounted. He does not feed on the living; he does not compel. He spends coherence, not power.

### Return
Before dawn, wagons roll through Astraea’s gates. Grain, leather, metal—breath for another week. The city wakes to carts piled with sacks, disbelief turning to quiet relief. No heralds; only the smell of flour and horse sweat.

### Confrontation
Reliquary threshold. Cassandra waits, eyes hard. “I forbade this.”

Joseph: “You forbade spending me. I spent enough to keep them eating. Not spectacle.”

Grand Maester: “Every disobedience frays your thread.”

Joseph: “Every empty bowl frays the city.”

Cassandra’s jaw clenches. She touches his shoulder—asking. He nods. She helps him inside. Cost tremors his fingers. Consent frames the reprimand; restraint frames the rage.

### Doctrine Kept
No living compelled, no dominion practiced, no Death Magic on the living. Supplies taken from an enemy who stripped them first. Ground not held—deterrent doctrine intact: strike, withdraw, do not conquer.

### Fallout
Council seethes at disobedience; Paladin accuser calls it “death worship.” Citizens eat. Cassandra adds another mark to the ledger of debts and survivals. Joseph sleeps like stone, coherence frayed but unbroken.

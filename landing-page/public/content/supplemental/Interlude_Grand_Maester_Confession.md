## Interlude — The Grand Maester's Confession

### Setting
Black Reliquary outer hall. Night. Rain ticks on stone. Joseph lies half-propped on a cot, eyes dim from the bridge strike and the corridor run for grain. Cassandra stands, arms folded, crown set aside. King Consort Aelius paces, ignorant of why he has been summoned. Grand Maester holds a sealed tin box, knuckles white.

### The Box Opens
Cassandra: “Open it.”

Grand Maester hesitates, then breaks the seal. Inside: brittle parchment, a ring of dark iron, a strip of child’s linen with faded initials not J.

Grand Maester: “Before I was guardian of restraint, I was guardian of secrets. This one now costs too much to keep.”

### Hidden Betrothal Named
He unrolls the parchment. It is a betrothal contract: Cassandra of Astraea to the firstborn of House Vale. The child’s given name is not Joseph.

Aelius stops pacing. “That is my brother’s name,” he breathes. “The brother we do not speak of.”

Cassandra’s voice is iron. “The brother taken. The deterrent forged. Joseph.”

Joseph looks up slowly, the name tasting foreign. “I had another name,” he says, more statement than question.

### Grand Maester’s Guilt
Grand Maester: “I took you. I erased the record. I renamed you. I chose deterrence over dynasty.”

Cassandra: “You stole a consort to build a weapon.”

Grand Maester meets her gaze, unflinching. “I stole a child to stop a world from burning. I broke consent to preserve it. I have carried that sin like iron in my ribs.”

### Aelius Reacts
Aelius staggers back, a hand to his mouth. “I am the substitute,” he whispers. Anger flares, then drains into shame. “My parents buried him. Buried you. To hide the failure of losing a child.”

Joseph: “They buried me before I died.”

### Cassandra’s Authority
Cassandra steps between the men. “Hear me. Joseph was mine before he was deterrent. He is deterrent now because the Grand Maester chose for me. I do not forgive that. I choose to continue, because the world still burns.”

### Consent and Doctrine
Grand Maester: “Doctrine forbids Death Knights from ruling. It forbids a monarch to wed one. I thought burying the betrothal would protect the throne.”

Cassandra: “You buried consent. You created this taboo by trying to dodge it. We live inside the sin you made.”

Joseph closes his eyes, voice low. “Consent broken at the start does not excuse breaking it now. We will not repeat you.”

### Aelius’s Choice
Aelius looks from parchment to Joseph. “I am king consort because you were taken. If I expose this, the court erupts. If I hide it, I live a fiction.”

Cassandra: “Choose. Ally. Obstacle. Witness. No dominion.”

Aelius exhales. “I choose to keep the realm alive. I will keep the fiction for them, and the truth for us. But I will not be your shield for free.”

Joseph: “Then name your cost. Consent applies to you as well.”

Aelius: “Respect. No more erasing. No more ghosts in my halls without my knowing.”

Cassandra nods once. “Done.”

### The Buried Name
Grand Maester whispers Joseph’s birth name aloud. It feels like a bell struck underwater. Joseph repeats it once, then lets it go.

Joseph: “I am Joseph. I am also the boy you stole. Both truths exist. I carry them. I carry the cost.”

### Closing
Cassandra closes the tin box. “This stays sealed from the court. The Paladin accuser will not have this fuel. When the war ends, we decide how to tell it. Until then, we use it as lever, not confession.”

Grand Maester bows his head. “Thank you for allowing me to speak it before I die.”

Cassandra’s gaze is flint. “You are not forgiven. You are necessary. That is all.”

Joseph reaches for her hand; she allows it, palm to palm—permission, not possession. Aelius watches, understanding at last the weight he never wanted. The rain keeps ticking. The world keeps burning. The truth now lives, even if sealed.

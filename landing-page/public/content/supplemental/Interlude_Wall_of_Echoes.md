## Interlude — Wall of Echoes

### Placement
Between Chapters 10–11, after the siege of Astraea. The living need time to replenish. Council, crown, and trade delegations demand visible defense. Cassandra hates the optics; Joseph bends to necessity, erecting an army of willing echoes in public view at severe personal cost.

### Call to the Walls
Midday, on the inner parapet. Delegations from fringe states watch, eyes weighing grain against fear. Councilors hiss: “Show them something, anything.” Cassandra stands rigid, jaw clenched.

Joseph steps onto the wall, helmetless. He does not speak to the crowd; he faces the killing fields. Muramasa remains sheathed. He breathes once, twice, voice low:

“Who will stand one last time?”

### The Summoning
The air thickens, cold layering over spring sun. From the edges of hearing, armor clinks; pale figures coalesce—archers, pikemen, cavalry without horses but with discipline. Their eyes are hollow light, not stolen fire; they nod, consent embodied.

Citizens flinch, then still. Children whisper. A trader drops a ledger. The Paladin champion’s knuckles whiten on his hilt.

### Internal Monologue — Holding the Weight
*Hold. Do not overreach. Each echo is a thread pulled from the Quiet. They answer because I ask, not command. Cost is not the call; cost is the maintenance. Breathe. Keep them stable until the living can stand again. Do not feed on the awe. Resist the need to make them more. Enough is enough.*

### Duration and Cost
Hours. The echoes stand as silent wards along the wall, bows ready, spears braced. Joseph’s eyes glow, then gutter, then glow again. Sweat freezes on his neck despite the sun. Cassandra stands near, ready to order dismissal; councilors time glances with their fear.

Grand Maester murmurs, “Release them,” more than once. Joseph shakes his head slightly. *Just a little longer. Give the living this picture. Give the traders this lie that we are inviolable.*

### Visible Toll
By dusk his hands tremor. A thin line of blood runs from his nose. The echoes flicker at the edges. Citizens see it—the cost made flesh. Whispers turn from fear to a rough, reverent hush.

### Release
Cassandra steps forward, voice low but carrying. “You have seen enough.” She looks at Joseph. Permission and command in one.

Joseph exhales. “Thank you,” he whispers to the echoes. They bow—disciplined even in departure—and dissolve like ash in reverse.

### Collapse
He drops to one knee, catching himself on the parapet. Cassandra’s hand hovers; he nods, and she steadies him. Councilors bite back accusations; the display already bought them what they wanted—trade signatures, a day’s morale, a myth sustained.

### Aftermath — Internal Monologue
*I bought them time with ghosts. Not conquest. Not dominion. Deterrence is theater with a blood price. Cassandra will hate me for spending. I will hate myself if I stop. Restraint is not hiding—it is choosing when to bleed where they can see it.*

### Doctrine Intact
No living compelled, no necromancy. Echoes were willing, called with consent, released when consented. The taboo groans under the weight of what was shown, but the city sleeps with ghostly sentinels in memory, and the living train one more night without bearing the wall alone.

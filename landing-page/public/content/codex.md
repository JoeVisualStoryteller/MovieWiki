# CODEX CONTRACT — POV & ROMANCE
Project: The Death Knight & The Queen
Canon Authority: Story Bible v5

These rules are mandatory. If a request conflicts, ask for clarification.

---

## POV RULES (HARD)
- Use close third person only.
- Never use first person unless the author explicitly requests it for a specific scene.
- Never use omniscient narration.
- One POV per scene. No mid-scene POV switching.

### Cassandra POV
- Governs politics, consent, authority, and continuity.
- Do not explain Death Magic doctrine.
- Emotional interiority is allowed, but framed as responsibility and restraint.

### Joseph POV
- Governs physical cost, restraint, and mortality.
- Interior narration must be sensory and limited.
- Desire is phrased as a question, never entitlement or action.
- Never explain Cassandra’s motivations.

### Interludes
- Must be labeled.
- No interiority.
- No romance.

---

## ROMANCE RULES (HARD)
- Romance is restraint-as-intimacy, not indulgence.
- Consent must be explicit or clearly observable.
- Cassandra initiates or affirms intimacy; Joseph never assumes.
- Restraint must be present in every encounter.
- Intimacy restores coherence only, never power.
- Intimacy never precedes escalation or combat.
- Public fiction is maintained at all times.

Romantic encounters are rare, earned, private, and cut on stabilization.

---

## FAILURE MODE
If a draft violates these rules:
- Do not continue the scene.
- Flag the violation and ask how to proceed.

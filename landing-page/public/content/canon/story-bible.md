# PART I — LORE LAW
*(Immutable rules governing the world)*

## 1. Core Truths
- The world is not saved; it is **delayed**.
- Power exists to test restraint.
- Choice matters more than outcome.

## 2. Magic
Magic redistributes consequence. Every use exacts cost.

### Domains
- **Vital Magic** — growth and healing; no resurrection.
- **Death Magic** — restraint, endings, deterrence; cost paid personally.
- **Dominion Magic** — control without choice; rejects cost.
- **Oath Magic** — belief-bound righteous force; fails in ambiguity.

## 3. Death & Afterlife
Death is final. Souls pass into **The Quiet**.
No soul may be recalled. Resurrection is impossible.

## 4. Necromancy vs Death Magic
- **Necromancy** is illegal everywhere. It is quantity over quality, a cheap imitation.
- **Death Magic** commands remains and echoes, never souls, and preserves consent.

## 5. The Undead
Undead raised by Death Magic:
- are visibly dead
- can think, speak, and remember
- are weaker than the living
- cannot heal or evolve

Joseph does not compel the dead. He calls for one final stand; only willing echoes answer.

## 6. Death Knights
Death Knights exist to:
- keep gods honest
- prevent wars before they begin
- make escalation unaffordable

They are deterrents, not soldiers.
They were designed to burn out and disappear.

## 7. Strategic Doctrine of Death Magic
Death Magic exists to annihilate escalation:
- leveling mustering forces
- erasing command structures
- sending irreversible warnings

Its purpose is prevention, not victory.

## 8. The Necrotic King
The Necrotic King was the **Second Death Knight**.
He lost restraint, was slain, and rejected finality.
He returned as dominion — a god by corruption, not origin.

## 9. The First Death Knight
The Grand Maester is the **First Death Knight**, over 1,000 years old.
He founded the Order and witnessed its first failure.

## 10. Political Law
The Crown is a continuity engine.
Royal marriage is statecraft.

No reigning monarch may marry a Death Knight.
Such a union would destabilize the world.

# PART II — NARRATIVE IMPLICATIONS
*(How the story must behave)*

## 11. Joseph
Joseph is fully aware of his power.
If he chose to abandon restraint, he could annihilate entire nations.

He chooses restraint every day.

## 12. Cassandra
As Princess, Cassandra knows Joseph is dangerous but not the full extent.
As Queen, she learns the truth gradually through pattern and consequence.
By the end, she knows enough to rule — never everything.

## 13. Knowledge Asymmetry
Only Joseph fully understands his power.
The world operates on myth, fear, and incomplete truth.
This ignorance preserves stability.

## 14. Orders
- Death Magic Order: extinct
- Paladin Orders: righteous but limited
- Living Knights: conventional, mortal
- Necromancers: outlawed, corruptive

No Order can replace another without catastrophe.

## 15. Romance
Joseph and Cassandra are romantically bound through **mutual restraint**.
Love increases cost; it never excuses power.
Their bond is forbidden, real, and unresolved.

## 16. Tragedy Structure
If Joseph acts without restraint, the world ends.
If Cassandra chooses love openly, the world destabilizes.
They endure so the world may continue.

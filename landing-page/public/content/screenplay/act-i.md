THE DEATH KNIGHT & THE QUEEN
ACT I — ORIGINS AND LOSS

---

SCENE 1 — PRINCESS MEETS JOSEPH
INT. PALACE CORRIDOR – DAY

Princess Cassandra walks with attendants through a stone corridor filled with banners and light.
They stop.

A knight stands alone at the far end.

JOSEPH.

Armor dark, unadorned, severe.

He kneels.

Not ceremonially.
Professionally.

He does not look at her.

CASSANDRA
You may rise.

He does.

Only then does he meet her eyes — briefly — before scanning the room beyond her.

CASSANDRA (CONT’D)
You don’t fear me.

JOSEPH
No, Your Highness.

CASSANDRA
Why?

A pause.

JOSEPH
You’re paying attention.

That lands.

Something quiet begins.

---

SCENE 2 — THE FIELD
EXT. OPEN FIELD – LATE AFTERNOON

Wind through tall grass.

Joseph sits against a tree.
Armor set aside.

Cassandra lies with her head in his lap, gazing at the sky.

Joseph sharpens a blade slowly.

CASSANDRA
Do you ever stop thinking?

JOSEPH
No.

She hums softly.

Closes her eyes.

He does not move.

The world feels held.

---

SCENE 3 — THE DRAGON
EXT. KINGDOM OUTSKIRTS – NIGHT

Fire.

A living dragon descends on the city.

Joseph pulls Cassandra behind stone cover.

JOSEPH
Do exactly as I say.

She nods.

Trust.

Joseph steps forward alone.

He cuts his palm.
Draws sigils in blood.

The earth answers.

An undead dragon rises.

Broken.
Bound.
Obedient.

Cassandra watches — not in horror, but shock.

The two beasts collide.

Fire.
Ash.
Bone.

Joseph falls to one knee afterward.

CASSANDRA
Joseph—

JOSEPH
I didn’t want you to see that.

CASSANDRA
I needed to.

---

SCENE 4 — THE GRAND HEALER
INT. GRAND HEALER’S CHAMBER – NIGHT

Joseph lies unconscious.

The Grand Healer works silently.

Cassandra stands rigid.

GRAND HEALER
They were never meant to win wars.
They were meant to end them before they began.

A pause.

GRAND HEALER (CONT’D)
They dance with death so that others may live.

Cassandra understands only part of it.

---

SCENE 5 — COURT DEFENSE
INT. COURT CHAMBER – DAY

Whispers.

Accusations.

A noble speaks.

NOBLE
If the Princess were not present, this would be treason.

Cassandra rises.

CASSANDRA
If Joseph intended treason,
there would be no court left to accuse him.

Silence.

She meets Joseph’s eyes.

This is the first time she stands for him.

---

SCENE 6 — DISMISSAL
INT. THRONE CHAMBER – DAY

The King dismisses Joseph.

JOSEPH
As the Crown commands.

Joseph leaves without protest.

---

SCENE 7 — WHAT HE LEAVES BEHIND
INT. QUEEN’S CHAMBER – NIGHT

Cassandra prepares for bed.

Servants leave.

When she turns back —

Joseph’s helmet sits on the nightstand.

She lifts it.

Heavy.

Real.

CASSANDRA (whisper)
I know.

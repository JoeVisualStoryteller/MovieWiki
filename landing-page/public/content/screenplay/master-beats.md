THE DEATH KNIGHT & THE QUEEN
MASTER CANONICAL SCREENPLAY ARCHIVE
(SCENE-BEAT EDITION — ACTS I–XX)

STATUS: CANON LOCKED
This document reflects the complete 20-Act / 20-Scene structure.

DIRECTOR PASS — QUICK CUES
- Keep stakes visible in every act: what clock, what cost, what line they refuse to cross.
- Show chain of command: Cassandra orders, Joseph executes with restraint; comms are terse.
- Make magic/war tactile: armor weight, breath frosting when Death Magic loads, environments dimming when he spends power.
- Action geography clear: where the squad is, what they defend/evacuate, how they extract.
- Romance stays private/consent-explicit: public fiction, private truth; proximity/eye-lines over spectacle; secret marriage remains sealed (Reliquary, Act X beat 19).
- Sound design: use silence before/after Death Magic; contrast battle roar with whispered oaths.

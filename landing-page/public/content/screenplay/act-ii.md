Reports of villages erased.
Undead sightings.

Whispers form a name.

Describe the dead.

Scattered. No order.

CASSANDRA
Then it isn’t him.

They doubt her.
She does not.

---

SCENE 9 — THE WEDDING
EXT. CATHEDRAL COURTYARD – DAY

Bells ring.

Cassandra stands beside her King Consort.

Across the crowd—

Unseen by all but her.

Their eyes meet.

A tear runs down his cheek.

He does not wipe it away.

He leaves before she can reach him.

---

SCENE 10 — RETURN AT THE GATES
EXT. CASTLE FIELDS – DUSK

Cassandra has no army.

Only survivors.

The Necrotic host advances.

Movement on the left—
ARCHERS.

Fear.

Then they turn and fire.

Undead formations rise—disciplined.

A skeletal commander issues orders.

To the east—
CAVALRY.

Joseph charges under Cassandra’s banner.

The line holds.

Joseph collapses.

SCENE 12 — GRAND HEALER’S WARNING
INT. HEALER’S CHAMBER – NIGHT

GRAND HEALER
He should not be alive.

CASSANDRA
But he is.

Because the cost has been shared.

---

SCENE 13 — THRONE ROOM: GOD STANDOFF
INT. THRONE ROOM – NIGHT

Living guards stiffen.
Eyes hollow.

JOSEPH
By the throne. Now.

A barrier of death magic seals the rulers in.

Joseph summons the ancient blade.

One versus twenty.

He ends them with precision.

The barrier holds.

THE NECROTIC KING appears.

NECROTIC KING
I am a god.

JOSEPH
Then you bleed like one.

Joseph reveals he is the last Death Knight.

JOSEPH
You do not kill a god with faith.
You pay for it.

The room understands.

Joseph weakens.

The barrier flickers.

The GRAND MAESTER enters—
drives his staff into the stone.

Power flows into Joseph.

The Necrotic King is forced back.

NECROTIC KING
You ran.

GRAND MAESTER
Someone had to.

The Necrotic King withdraws.

SCENE 14 — FEEDING REVEALED
INT. THRONE ROOM – CONTINUOUS

NECROTIC KING
They’ve been feeding you.

A Death Knight steps forward.

DEATH KNIGHT
We owed him time.

Joseph accepts it.

Cassandra realizes the truth.

---

SCENE 15 — AFTERMATH
INT. THRONE ROOM – LATER

Guards finally enter.
They could not cross the barrier.

Joseph is carried to heal.

We will plan as if his life is not the answer.

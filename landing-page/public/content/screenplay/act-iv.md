# ACT IV — FULL SCREENPLAY (VERBATIM CONSOLIDATION)

ACT IV — SCENE 1
THE PALADIN RETURNS

EXT. OUTER ROAD TO THE CAPITAL — DUSK

Ash drifts across a ruined road.

What once led caravans now leads only men with nothing left to lose.

At the head of the column rides THE PALADIN.

His armor is no longer immaculate.
The sigils of his order have been scored through, not removed—defaced with intent.
White cloth once worn as a symbol of purity now hangs torn and darkened with old blood.

Behind him march PALADIN REMNANTS—not an army, but a conviction made flesh.
Knights. Zealots. Survivors of holy orders shattered by a war they were never meant to win.

They move with purpose.

Not fear.
Not doubt.

Hate, sharpened into clarity.

UNBOUND

A single lamp burns low.

Cassandra enters without crown, without consort’s colors.

This is the first time they choose each other without illusion.

They share a single night unbound by duty.
